2       License Grant

2.1     The PDF Library product is licensed under exactly one of the following license types.
You agree to abide by the restrictions listed below.

(a) Trial Download License

Under this License the PDF Library may be downloaded for free and used by You for a limited
period for development and initial testing. The intention is to allow You time to assess
whether the PDF Library is suitable for their purposes. Under this License, the PDF Library
MAY NOT be used outside of a development environment.

(b) CPU License

Under this License You are granted the non-transferable, non-exclusive and perpetual right to
link the PDF Library to part of an applet or product running on (or in the case of
applets, downloaded from) a fixed number of production servers - defined as a computer run by
You including the development environment. The price of this License depends on the total
number of CPUs used by programs linked to the PDF Library, not the number of physical machines
used. This License may be transferred between servers, provided that the number of server CPUs
concurrently running products linked to the PDF Library never exceeds the number of server
CPUs specified in this License Agreement.

(c) OEM License

(i) Under this License You are granted the global, irrevocable, non-transferable,
non-exclusive and perpetual right to link the PDF Library to products requiring the PDF
library as an integral part, and that are developed, marketed and distributed by You and
distributed to third parties. The price of this License is based on the total number of
products distributed that are linked to the PDF Library, including any non-free updates to
the Product. The products distributed by You and linked to the PDF Library must add
considerable functionality to the PDF Library. Programs, which in essence mimic the
functionality of the PDF Library, or a subset thereof, are expressly prohibited under this
License.

(ii) This License includes the right for You to sub-license to third parties the
right to use this PDF Library only as part of the product developed by You - any other use
will require a separate license agreement with the Licensor. This License specifically
excludes use which falls under the category of a "CPU License" as defined above.

(iii) You undertake and warrant that you will not reveal, divulge or disclose to any third
party whatsoever the key code of this OEM License and further undertake to embed the OEM key
code in a secure manner.

(d) Annual Subscription License

Under this License You are granted the non-transferable and non-exclusive right to link the
PDF Library to a website or intranet. The price of this License depends on the total number
of CPUs used by programs linked to the PDF Library, not the number of physical machines
used. Fees for this License are renewed annually as a subscription. This License may be
transferred between servers, provided that the number of server CPUs concurrently running
products linked to the PDF Library never exceeds the number of server CPUs specified in
this License Agreement.



3       Copyright

3.1     You acknowledge that no title to the intellectual property in any part of the Product
is transferred to You. You further acknowledge that title and full ownership rights to the
Product will remain the exclusive property of The Licensor and its suppliers and You will
not acquire any rights to the Product except as expressly set out in this Agreement. You agree
that any copies of any part of the Product will contain the same proprietary notices which
appear on and in the Product (as appropriate).

3.2     The Licensor warrants that all intellectual property rights in the Product either
reside with itself or its suppliers and that the Licensor is entitled to enter into this
Agreement and that use of the Product by an Authorised User is not in breach of any third
party's intellectual property rights. The Licensor agrees to indemnify You against all costs,
claims and liabilities arising from breach of this warranty provided that you immediately
notify the Licensor about any alleged breach and render all reasonable assistance to the
Licensor (at the cost of the Licensor) in defending any such claim.

3.3     You agree that this License does not include ownership of the source-code for the PDF
library, which may be covered by a separate license.


4       Third party copyright notices

(http://www.famfamfam.com), and are used here with his kind permission.

4.2     The PDF Library includes JBIG2 image decoding routines originally written by
IDRsolutions and modified by the Licensor. A condition of distribution for these
routines is that the following copyright notice be included:

               derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

         THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY IDRsolutions ``AS IS'' AND ANY
         EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED

         DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL IDRsolutions BE LIABLE FOR ANY
         DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
         (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES;
         LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND
         ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT
         (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS
         SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

5       Restrictions

transfer the rights obtained under this License to any third party, except as defined under
the Runtime License defined above.

5.2     The PDF Library is distributed in digital form only from the Website. We will not
distribute the product in any other form.


6       Support

6.1     In the event of bugs being found in the PDF Library over and above those known bugs
and limitations listed in the accompanying documentation and not including enhancements to the
documented functionality of the PDF Library, the Licensor agrees to provide updates free of
charge which can be downloaded from the Website and used with the same license key as the
original version licensed by You. Although the licensor will endeavour to keep the PDF Library
bug-free, they specifically exclude any warranty to that effect, and also specifically deny
any time span either express or implied for the correction of any bugs found.

6.2     Technical support over and above the level described in the clause above is available
by email only from the licensor at an additional cost.


7       Reverse Engineering

You will not attempt to reverse compile, modify, translate, or disassemble the Product or any
part of the Product (including anything that may from time to time be available in the
Members' Area) in whole or in part (except as provided for by section 50B of the Copyright,
Design and Patents Act 1998 (as amended)).


8       Limited Warranties and Exclusions of Liability

8.1     No warranty of any kind, including the implied warranty of merchantability and fitness
for purpose, is available if this product is licensed under the "Trial Download" License
defined above. For other license types ONLY, the following apply

8.2     The Licensor warrants that the Product may be used substantially in accordance with
any online information on the Website at the time of purchase and with any demonstration
contained within the Website and as described in its accompanying documentation.

8.3     The Licensor further warrants that the PDF Library is free from backdoors and any
form of disablement, which would damage or render any system using the PDF Library
inoperable.  The Licensor further warrants that even in the event of the breach of this
License by You, the Licensor will not impair the operation of the PDF Library except pursuant
to an order of court.

8.4     EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTIES SET OUT ABOVE, THE LICENSOR MAKES NO OTHER EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS THE WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IF SUCH DISCLAIMER IS NOT PERMITTED
BY LAW, THE DURATION OF ANY SUCH IMPLIED WARRANTIES IS LIMITED TO [90] DAYS FROM THE DATE OF
DELIVERY.

8.5     Any information and advice on the Website is by its nature general and should not be
relied on by You without obtaining independent advice and verification. The Licensor cannot
therefore accept responsibility for any losses arising as a result of reliance placed on such
information and advice.


9       Severability

In the event of invalidity of any provision of this Agreement, the parties agree that such
invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Agreement.


10      No Liability for Consequential Damages

EXCEPT FOR THE LICENSOR'S INDEMNIFICATION AND EACH PARTY'S CONFIDENTIALLITY OBLIGATIONS
HEREUNDER, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE,
INCIDENTAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE PRODUCT, EVEN IF THE
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR'S
LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, EXCEED
THE LICENSE FEE PAID BY YOU.


11      Confidentiality Obligations

11.1    If either party (the "Recipient") obtains access to Confidential information of the
other through disclosure by the other (the "Disclosing Party") or by any other means, the
Recipient agrees that it will not use the Confidential Information (except as authorised in
the Agreement) or disclose the Confidential Information to any third party without the prior
written consent of the Disclosing Party. For the purpose of this Agreement, "Confidential
Information" shall mean all information about or belonging to the Disclosing Party that is not
a matter of public knowledge and all trade secrets and intellectual property owned or licensed
by the Disclosing Party. The restrictions of this paragraph shall not apply to any information
that: (i) is already rightfully known by the Recipient free of any confidentiality obligation;
(ii) is or becomes publicly known except through any wrongful act of the Recipient; (iii) is
independently developed by the Recipient without breach of this Agreement; or (iv) is subject
to disclosure pursuant to a subpoena, judicial or governmental requirement or order, provided
that the Recipient has given the Disclosing Party sufficient prior notice of such subpoena,
requirement, or order, to permit the Disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity to object to
the subpoena, requirement, or order and to allow the Disclosing Party the opportunity to seek
a protective order or other appropriate remedy. The obligations described in this paragraph
shall survive termination of the Agreement.

11.2    Either party shall have the right to publish, cause to have published, or use the name
of the other party and any information about its relationship with the other party, including
but not limited to the inclusion of the other party's name in reference lists or for
advertising or other promotional purposes, unless this is expressly prohibited in writing by
either party.


12      Termination

12.1    The Licensor may forthwith terminate this Agreement (without prejudice to any prior
accrued rights) in the event of the following:

12.1.1  You failing to remedy any material breach of this Agreement (insofar as such breach is
reasonably capable of remedy) within 30 days of written notice of such breach;

12.1.2  You being subject to a bankruptcy or compulsary winding up notice or a receiving
order or having an administrator appointed in respect of your affairs (save as part of a
restructuring or amalgamation otherwise than by reason of your insolvency).

12.2    You will forthwith on termination remove all copies of any part of the Product from
your computer system(s) and remove all license keys.


13      General

13.1    If any party does not fully enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time, it
will not prevent it from doing so later in respect of a particular breach or any future
breach.

13.2    Any notice served pursuant to this Agreement must be in writing, addressed to a party
at the last known address for that party and sent by:

(a)  certified mail or common overnight courier, in which case the notice will (if properly
addressed) be deemed received upon the signature of the addressee; or
(b) by hand

13.3    Neither party will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement insofar as that
breach is a result of an act of event beyond that party's reasonable control but if that
situation arises, the relevant party will make reasonable efforts to overcome that problem
as soon as reasonably possible.

13.4    This Agreement is not intended to benefit anyone other than the parties to it.

        </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><b>3. Distribution Obligations.</b></p>
    <ul><li><p> <b>3.1. Availability of Source Code.</b></p>

        <p>Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise
            make available in Executable form must also be made
            available in Source Code form and that Source Code form
            must be distributed only under the terms of this License.
            You must include a copy of this License with every copy of
            the Source Code form of the Covered Software You
            distribute or otherwise make available.  You must inform

            as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source
            Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium
            customarily used for software exchange.</p>

    </li><li><p> <b>3.2. Modifications.</b></p>

        <p>The Modifications that You create or to which You
            contribute are governed by the terms of this License.  You
            represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your
            original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to
            grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>

    </li><li><p> <b>3.3. Required Notices.</b></p>

        <p>You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications
            that identifies You as the Contributor of the
            Modification.  You may not remove or alter any copyright,
            patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered
            Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive
            text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial
            Developer.</p>

    </li><li><p> <b>3.4. Application of Additional Terms.</b></p>

        <p>You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered
            Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the
            applicable version of this License or the
            recipients rights hereunder.  You may choose to
            offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
            indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
            recipients of Covered Software.  However, you may do so
            only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
            Developer or any Contributor.  You must make it absolutely
            clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
            liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
            hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
            Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
            Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
            support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>

    </li><li><p> <b>3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.</b></p>

        <p>You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered
            Software under the terms of this License or under the
            terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
            different from this License, provided that You are in
            compliance with the terms of this License and that the
            license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit
            or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code
            form from the rights set forth in this License.  If You
            distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
            different license, You must make it absolutely clear that
            any terms which differ from this License are offered by
            You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor.
            You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
            every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
            Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
            such terms You offer.</p>

    </li><li><p> <b>3.6. Larger Works.</b></p>

        <p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
            Software with other code not governed by the terms of this
            License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
            product.  In such a case, You must make sure the
            requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
            Software.</p>
    </li></ul></li><li><p><b>4. Versions of the License.</b></p>
    <ul><li><p>
        <b>4.1. New Versions.</b></p>

        <p>Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward
            and may publish revised and/or new versions of this
            License from time to time.  Each version will be given a
            distinguishing version number.  Except as provided in
            Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the
            right to modify this License.</p>

    </li><li><p>
        <b>4.2. Effect of New Versions.</b></p>

        <p>You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
            version of the License under which You originally received
            the Covered Software.  If the Initial Developer includes a
            notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
            distributed or otherwise made available under any
            subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
            version of the License under which You originally received
            the Covered Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to
            use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
            available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
            License published by the license steward.</p>

    </li><li><p>
        <b>4.3. Modified Versions.</b></p>

        <p>When You are an Initial Developer and You want to
            create a new license for Your Original Software, You may
            create and use a modified version of this License if You:
            (a) rename the license and remove any references to
            the name of the license steward (except to note that the
            license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
            make it clear that the license contains terms which differ
            from this License.</p>
    </li></ul></li><li><p>

    <b>5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</b></p>

    <p>COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN

        OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
        SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
        CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF ANY

    <b>6. TERMINATION.</b></p>

    <ul><li><p><b>6.1.</b> This License and the rights granted
        hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply
        with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30
        days of becoming aware of the breach.  Provisions which, by
        their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination
        of this License shall survive.</p>

    </li><li><p><b>6.2.</b>
        If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
        judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the
        Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is
        referred to as Participant) alleging that the Participant Software
        (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
        or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial
        Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and
        all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant,
        the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)
        and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License

        automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if

        Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or
        pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.</p>

    </li><li><p><b>6.3.</b> In the event of termination under
        Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses
        that have been
        validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
        termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any
        distributor) shall survive termination.</p>

    <b>7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</b></p>

    <p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER
        TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL
        YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
        DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF

        SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
        INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL,
        WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL
        OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL
        HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS
        LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH
        OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS
        NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
        LIMITATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR

        EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

        (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered
        Software with only those rights set forth herein.  This
        U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,
        any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that
        addresses Government rights in computer software under this

    <b>9. MISCELLANEOUS.</b></p>

    <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning

        specified in a notice contained within the Original Software
        (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
        otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions
        conflict-of-law provisions.  Any
        litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
        jurisdiction of the courts located in the
        jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within
        the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for

        reasonable attorneys fees and expenses.  The
        application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
        the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any
        law or regulation which provides that the language of a
        contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not

    Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
    royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,
    offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
    Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
    license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
    Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
    such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
    by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
    combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
    licensed hereunder.</p>

<p class="list">c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor
    grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances
    are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
    secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
    example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient
    to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire
    that license before distributing the Program.</p>

<p class="list">d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it
    has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
    the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</p>

<p><b>3. REQUIREMENTS</b></p>

<p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code
    form under its own license agreement, provided that:</p>

<p class="list">a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this
    Agreement; and</p>

<p class="list">b) its license agreement:</p>

<p class="list">i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors
    all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
    or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
    conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</p>

<p class="list">ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors
    all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;</p>

<p class="list">iii) states that any provisions which differ from this
    Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
    party; and</p>

<p class="list">iv) states that source code for the Program is available
    from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
    reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
    exchange.</p>

<p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>

<p class="list">a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p>

<p class="list">b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each
    copy of the Program.</p>

<p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
    within the Program.</p>

<p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
    Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
    Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p>

<p><b>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b></p>

<p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
    responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
    like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of
    the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial
    product offering should do so in a manner which does not create
    potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor
    includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
    (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and
    indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;)
    against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;)
    arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
    party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
    acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
    distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
    obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
    relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In
    order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify
    the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
    Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
    Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
    Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
    expense.</p>

<p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
    performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
    Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
    must pay those damages.</p>

<p><b>5. NO WARRANTY</b></p>

<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
    PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
    OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
    ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
    OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
    responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
    distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
    exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to
    the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,
    damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or
    interruption of operations.</p>

<p><b>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</b></p>

<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
    NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
    INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
    WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
    LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
    NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
    DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
    HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p><b>7. GENERAL</b></p>

<p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
    by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>

<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
    software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
    Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the
    date such litigation is filed.</p>

<p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time
    after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights
    under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and
    distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,
    Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by
    Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p>

<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
    Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
    copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
    Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including
    revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the
    Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse
    Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may
    assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a
    suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be
    given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
    Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
    Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version
    of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
    Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
    expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
    rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under
    this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
    otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
    Agreement are reserved.</p>

<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
    the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party
    to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more
    than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its
    rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>

</p>

<pre>
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

<h3><a id="SEC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</a></h3>

<p>
    <strong>0.</strong>
    This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
    this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
    Each licensee is addressed as "you".
</p>
<p>
    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
</p>
<p>
    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
    which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
    included without limitation in the term "modification".)
</p>
<p>
    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
    and installation of the library.
</p>
<p>
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
    writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
    and what the program that uses the Library does.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1.</strong>
    You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
    Library.
</p>
<p>
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
    fee.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.</strong>
    You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>a)</strong>
        The modified work must itself be a software library.</li>
    <li><strong>b)</strong>
        You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</li>

    <li><strong>c)</strong>
        You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</li>

    <li><strong>d)</strong>
        If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
        table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
        the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
        is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
        in the event an application does not supply such function or
        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
        its purpose remains meaningful.
        <p>
            (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
            a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
            application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
            application-supplied function or table used by this function must
            be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
            root function must still compute square roots.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
    sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
    reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
    this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
    distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same
    sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
    distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
    permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
    each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
    the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
    based on the Library.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
    the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
    or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
    this License.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3.</strong>
    You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
    instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
    that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
    these notices.
</p>
<p>
    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
</p>
<p>
    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
    the Library into a program that is not a library.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4.</strong>
    You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
    medium customarily used for software interchange.
</p>
<p>
    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>5.</strong>
    A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
</p>
<p>
    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
    library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
</p>
<p>
    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
</p>
<p>
    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
    Library will still fall under Section 6.)
</p>
<p>
    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>6.</strong>
    As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
    engineering for debugging such modifications.
</p>
<p>
    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
    directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
    of these things:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete
        corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library
        including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
        distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an
        executable linked with the Library, with the complete
        machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code
        and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and
        then relink to produce a modified executable containing the
        modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the
        contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily
        be able to recompile the application to use the modified
        definitions.)</li>

    <li><strong>b)</strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism
        for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that
        (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the
        user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into
        the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
        version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
        modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the
        work was made with.</li>

    <li><strong>c)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer,
        valid for at least three years, to give the same user the
        materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
        than the cost of performing this distribution.</li>

    <li><strong>d)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by
        offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent
        access to copy the above specified materials from the same
        place.</li>

    <li><strong>e)</strong> Verify that the user has already received
        a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user
        a copy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
    Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
    reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
    the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
    the executable.
</p>
<p>
    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
    accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
    distribute.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities that are a work
    based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with
    other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
    such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of
    the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is
    otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy
        of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other
        library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of
        the Sections above.</li>

    <li><strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined
        library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the
        Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined
        form of the same work.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with,
    or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this
    License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link
    with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically
    terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have
    received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
    their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>9.</strong>
    You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Library or works based on it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>10.</strong>
    Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
    this License.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>11.</strong>
    If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
</p>
<p>
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
</p>
<p>
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
</p>
<p>
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>12.</strong>
    If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
    excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
    written in the body of this License.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>13.</strong>
    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
</p>
<p>
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software Foundation.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>14.</strong>
    If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
    write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
    and reuse of software generally.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>15.</strong>
    BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>16.</strong>
    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.

<p>?Designated User? shall mean a single distinct person for whom You have purchased a license to use the Software, whether such person is an employee acting within the scope of their employment with You or Your consultant or contractor acting within the scope of the services they provide for You. A Designated User can be replaced with a new Designated User only after being a Designated User for a minimum of six (6) months.  </p>

<p>?End User? means an end user of Your Application who acquires a license to such product solely for their own internal use and not for distribution, resale, user interface design, or software development purposes. </p>

<p>?Modification? means: a) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file included in the original Software or previous Modifications created by You, and/or b) any new file that leverages any part of the original Software or previous Modifications. </p>

<p>In addition to the other terms contained herein, We grant to You a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable license to install and use the Software on a single computer (the ?Trial License?) strictly for Your internal evaluation and review purposes and not for production purposes. This Trial License applies only if You have registered with Us for a Trial License of the Software and shall be effective for forty-five (45) consecutive days following the date of registration (?the Trial Period?). You may only register for a Trial License once in any eighteen month period. You agree not to use a Trial License for any purpose other than determining whether to purchase a license to the Software. You are explicitly not permitted to distribute the Software to any user outside the Organization on whose behalf you have undertaken this license. Your rights to use the Trial License will immediately terminate upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of the Trial Period, or (ii) such time that You purchase a license to the Software. We reserve the right to terminate Your Trial License at any time in Our absolute and sole discretion. </p>

<p>You may modify the ?Sample Code? solely for the purposes of designing, developing and testing Your own Applications. However, You are permitted to use, copy and redistribute its modified Sample Code only if all of the following conditions are met: (a) You include Our copyright notice (if any) with Your Application, including every location in which any other copyright notice appears in such Application; and (b) You do not otherwise use Our name, logos or other of Our trademarks to market Your Application, unless otherwise agree by Us in writing. </p>

<h3>8. <span class="caps">VERIFICATION</span></h3>

<p>We or a certified auditor acting on Our behalf, may, upon Our reasonable request and at Our expense, audit You with respect to the use of the Software. Such audit may be conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to Your place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Your facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Your business activities. We shall not remove, copy, or redistribute any electronic material during the course of an audit. If an audit reveals that You are using the Software in a way that is in material violation of the terms of the License Agreement, then You shall pay Our reasonable costs of conducting the audit. In the case of a material violation, You agree to pay Us any amounts owing that are attributable to the unauthorized use. In the alternative, We reserve the right, at Our sole option, to terminate the licenses for the Software, in addition to any other remedies available under law.</p>

<h3>9. <span class="caps">PAYMENT</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">TAXES</span></h3>

<p>If credit has been extended to You by Us, all payments under this License Agreement are due within thirty (30) days of the date We mail an invoice to You. If We have not extended credit to You, You shall be required to make payment concurrent with the delivery of the Software by Us. All amounts payable are gross amounts but exclusive of any value added tax, use tax, sales tax or similar tax (?Transaction Taxes?), all of which shall be your sole responsibility. You shall be entitled to withhold from payments any applicable withholding taxes and comply with all applicable tax legislation. Each party shall pay all taxes (including, but not limited to, taxes based upon its income) or levies imposed on it under applicable laws, regulations and tax treaties as a result of this License Agreement and any payments made hereunder (including those required to be withheld or deducted from payments); provided that You shall be responsible for all Transactions Taxes and shall pay or reimburse Us for the same upon invoice. Each party shall furnish evidence of such paid taxes as is sufficient to enable the other party to obtain any credits available to it, including original withholding tax certificates.</p>

<h3>10. <span class="caps">SUPPORT</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">UPDATES</span></h3>

<p>You are not entitled to any support for the Software under this License Agreement. All support must be purchased separately and will be subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Sencha support agreement. You are entitled to receive minor version updates to the Software (i.e. versions identified as follows (X.Y, X.Y+1). You are not entitled to receive major version updates (i.e. X.Y, X+1.Y) or bug fix updates to the Software (X.Y.Z, X.Y.Z+1), unless purchased independently of this license.</p>

<h3>11. <span class="caps">MISCELLANEOUS</span></h3>

<p>The license granted herein applies only to the version of the Software available when purchased in connection with the terms of this License Agreement. Any previous or subsequent license granted to You for use of the Software shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the agreement entered in connection with purchase of that version of the Software. You agree that you will comply with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to the Software, including without limitation all export and re-export control laws and regulations.</p>

<p>While redistributing the Software or Modifications thereof as part of Your Application, You may choose to offer acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License Agreement. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on our behalf.   You shall indemnify Us, or at Our option, defend Us against any claim, suit or proceeding brought against Us (i) arising by reason of Your accepting any such support, warranty, indemnity or additional liability; or (ii) arising out of the use, reproduction or distribution of Your Application, except to the extent such claim is solely based on the inclusion of the Software therein.  Further, You agree only to distribute the Software pursuant to an enforceable written agreement for Our benefit that includes all the limitations and restrictions of this License Agreement and is as protective of Us and Software as is this License Agreement.  For clarity, You must purchase Designated User licenses for each contractor or consultant who uses the Software to create an Application on your behalf (including system integrators), whether or not such contractor or consultant has its own license to the Software.  </p>

<h4 id="section-3.1">3.1. Application of License</h4>
<p> The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section <a href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section <a href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>. </p>

<h4 id="section-3.2">3.2. Availability of Source Code</h4>
<p> Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. </p>

<h4 id="section-3.3">3.3. Description of Modifications</h4>
<p> You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. </p>

<h4 id="section-3.4">3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</h4>
<p id="section-3.4-a"><b>3.4.a. Third Party Claims:</b> If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> or <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section <a href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. </p>
<p id = "section-3.4-b"><b>3.4.b.

<h4 id="section-3.5">3.5. Required Notices</h4>
<p> You must duplicate the notice in <a href="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a> in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in <a href="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a>. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. </p>

<h4 id = "section-3.6">3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions</h4>

The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.

<h4 id = "section-3.7">3.7. Larger Works</h4>

<p> This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in <a href="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a> and to related Covered Code. </p>

<h4 id="section-6.1">6.1. New Versions</h4>
<p> The <em class="u">H2 Group</em> may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. </p>

<h4 id = "section-6.2">6.2. Effect of New Versions</h4>
<p> Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the <em class="u">H2 Group</em>. No one other than the <em class="u">H2 Group</em> has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. </p>

<h4 id = "section-6.3">6.3. Derivative Works</h4>
<p> If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases <em class="u">"H2 Group", "H2"</em> or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the <em class="u">H2 License</em>. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in <a href="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a> shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) </p>

<h3 id = "section-7">7. Disclaimer of Warranty</h3>
<p> Covered code is provided under this license on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without limitation, warranties that the covered code is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any respect, you (not the initial developer or any other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this license. No use of any covered code is authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer. </p>

<h3 id = "section-8">8. Termination</h3>
<p id="section-8.1">8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. </p>

<p id="section-8.2">8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that: </p>
<p id = "section-8.2-a">8.2.a. such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> and/or <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a> of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> and/or <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a> automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. </p>
<p id = "section-8.2-b">8.2.b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(<a href="#section-2.1-b">b</a>) and 2.2(<a href="#section-2.2-b">b</a>) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. </p>

<p id = "section-8.3">8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> or <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a> shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. </p>

<p id = "section-8.4">8.4. In the event of termination under Sections <a href="#section-8.1">8.1</a> or <a href="#section-8.2">8.2</a> above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. </p>

<h3 id = "section-9">9. Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p> Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial developer, any other contributor, or any distributor of covered code, or any supplier of any of such parties, be liable to any person for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you. </p>

<h3 id = "section-10">10. United States Government End Users</h3>
<p> The Covered Code is a "commercial item", as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (October 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation", as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (September 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. </p>

<h3 id = "section-11">11. Miscellaneous</h3>
<p> This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. </p>

<h3 id = "section-12">12. Responsibility for Claims</h3>
<p> As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. </p>

<h3 id = "section-13">13. Multiple-Licensed Code</h3>
<p> Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of this or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in <a href="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a>. </p>

<h3 id="exhibit-a">Exhibit A</h3>

 CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
 documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
 distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
 Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
 acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
 the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
 conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
 derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
 necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
 combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
 including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
 Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
 reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
 distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
 derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
 Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
 Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
 Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
 This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
 Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
 addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
 Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
 which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
 to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
 Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
 property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
 Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
 intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
 rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
 responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
 For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
 distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
 before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
 copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set
 forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
 own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
 conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
 non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
 fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
 damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
 damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
 by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
 Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or
 through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
 Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
 any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
 originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
 respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
 intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
 includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
 which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
 a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
 Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
 every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
 and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
 actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
 extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
 connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
 offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
 relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
 to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
 Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
 control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
 related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
 any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
 offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
 Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
 related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
 Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
 Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
 Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
 requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
 Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
 "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
 IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
 NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
 Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
 distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
 rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
 program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
 programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
 CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
 SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
 PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
 STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
 OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
 GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
 law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
 terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
 provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
 provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
 a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
 lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
 under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
 addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
 itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
 infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
 Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
 comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
 not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
 such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
 Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
 reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
 and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
 survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
 order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
 modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
 publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
 No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
 IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve
 as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
 Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
 Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
 under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
 is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
 Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
 intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
 expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
 expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
 intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
 Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
 after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
 any resulting litigation.

LICENSE RIGHTS
We grant you a nonexclusive, nontransferable limited license to use the programs only for the purpose of developing, testing, prototyping and demonstrating your application, and not for any other purpose. If you use the application you develop under this license for any internal data processing or for any commercial or production purposes, or you want to use the programs for any purpose other than as permitted under this agreement, you must obtain a production release version of the program by contacting us or an Oracle reseller to obtain the appropriate license. You acknowledge that we may not produce a production release version of the program and any development efforts undertaken by you are at your own risk. We may audit your use of the programs. Program documentation, if available, may accessed online at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/indexes/documentation/index.html.

Ownership and Restrictions We retain all ownership and intellectual property rights in the programs. The programs may be installed on one computer only, and used by one person in the operating environment identified by us. You may make one copy of the programs for backup purposes.

You may not:
- use the programs for your own internal data processing or for any commercial or production purposes, or use the programs for any purpose except the development of your application;
- use the application you develop with the programs for any internal data processing or commercial or production purposes without securing an appropriate license from us;
- continue to develop your application after you have used it for any internal data processing, commercial or production purpose without securing an appropriate license from us, or an Oracle reseller;
- remove or modify any program markings or any notice of our proprietary rights;
- make the programs available in any manner to any third party;
- use the programs to provide third party training;
- assign this agreement or give or transfer the programs or an interest in them to another individual or entity; - cause or permit reverse engineering (unless required by law for interoperability), disassembly or decompilation of the programs;
- disclose results of any program benchmark tests without our prior consent.

Export
You agree that U.S. export control laws and other applicable export and import laws govern your use of the programs, including technical data; additional information can be found on Oracle's Global Trade Compliance web site located at http://www.oracle.com/products/export/index.html. You agree that neither the programs nor any direct product thereof will be exported, directly, or indirectly, in violation of these laws, or will be used for any purpose prohibited by these laws including, without limitation, nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons proliferation.

Disclaimer of Warranty and Exclusive Remedies
THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WE FURTHER DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.

IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, INCURRED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES HEREUNDER SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS (U.S. $1,000).


Trial Programs Included With Orders
We may include additional programs with an order which may be used for trial purposes only. You will have 30 days from the delivery date to evaluate these programs. Any use of these programs after the 30 day trial period requires you to obtain the applicable license. Programs licensed for trial purposes are provided "as is" and we do not provide technical support or any warranties for these programs.

No Technical Support
Our technical support organization will not provide technical support, phone support, or updates to you for the programs licensed under this agreement.

End of Agreement
You may terminate this agreement by destroying all copies of the programs. We have the right to terminate your right to use the programs if you fail to comply with any of the terms of this agreement, in which case you shall destroy all copies of the programs.

Relationship Between the Parties
The relationship between you and us is that of licensee/licensor. Neither party will represent that it has any authority to assume or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party, nor to represent the other party as agent, employee, franchisee, or in any other capacity. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to limit either party's right to independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar to the other party's products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not included in such software.

Open Source
"Open Source" software - software available without charge for use, modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms that require the user to make the user's modifications to the Open Source software or any software that the user 'combines' with the Open Source software freely available in source code form. If you use Open Source software in conjunction with the programs, you must ensure that your use does not: (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the Oracle programs; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under our intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Oracle programs. For example, you may not develop a software program using an Oracle program and an Open Source program where such use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the Oracle program and the Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) if the Open Source program is licensed under a license that requires any "modifications" be made freely available. You also may not combine the Oracle program with programs licensed under the GNU General Public License ("GPL") in any manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Oracle program or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL.

Entire Agreement
You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the programs and licenses, and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations. If any term of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective.
