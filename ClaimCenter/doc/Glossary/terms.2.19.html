      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051846">safe order</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1122153">See </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">safe-ordered messaging</span>.</div>
      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1065721">safe-ordered messages</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1213648">Safe ordering is a messaging feature that prevents related messages from sending out of order from each other. This is called </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">safe order</span>. Messages are grouped by their related <span class="e_-_emphasis">primary object</span> for each messaging destination. For important definitions, see <span class="e_-_emphasis">primary entity</span>.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1213653">Messages send in creation order with other messages associated with that same primary object for that destination. Any messages associated with a primary object for that destination are called </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">safe-ordered</span> messages. The application waits for an acknowledgement before processing the next safe-ordered message for that same primary object for that destination. In other words, delays or errors for that destination <span class="s_-_strong">blocks</span> further sending of messages for that same destination for that same primary object.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1213654">In ClaimCenter, by default any messages associated with a </a><span class="s_-_strong">claim</span> send to each destination ordered by claim. Optionally, if a messaging destination sets <span class="cv_-_computer_voice">Contact</span> as its alternative <span class="e_-_emphasis">primary entity</span>, messages associated with a <span class="s_-_strong">contact</span> send grouped by contact for each messaging destination and sent in creation order. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1213758">In PolicyCenter, by default messages associated with an </a><span class="s_-_strong">account</span> send grouped by account for each messaging destination and sent in creation order. Optionally, if a messaging destination sets <span class="cv_-_computer_voice">Contact</span> as its alternative <span class="e_-_emphasis">primary entity</span>, messages associated with a <span class="s_-_strong">contact</span> send grouped by contact for each messaging destination and sent in creation order. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1213657">There are PolicyCenter objects that are not associated with a primary entity. For example, </a><span class="cv_-_computer_voice">User</span>. All messages that are not associated with a claim (the primary object) are called <span class="e_-_emphasis">non-safe-ordered</span> messages. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1213658">In BillingCenter, there is no default primary entity. However, every messaging destination can set its own </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">alternative primary entity</span> to one of several values in the <span class="ui_-_UI_element">Messaging</span> editor: <span class="cv_-_computer_voice">Account</span>, <span class="cv_-_computer_voice">Producer</span>, <span class="cv_-_computer_voice">PolicyPeriod</span>, or <span class="cv_-_computer_voice">Contact</span>. Messages will group and order for each destination by the primary entity for that messaging destination.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1213791">These are </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">safe-ordered </span>messages</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1213837">There are objects in all applications that are </a><span class="s_-_strong">not</span> associated with the primary entity for a particular messaging destination. In all applications, messages associated with <span class="cv_-_computer_voice">User</span> and <span class="cv_-_computer_voice">Group</span> objects. For ClaimCenter, a <span class="cv_-_computer_voice">Catastrophe</span> message is typically unassociated with a primary entity. All messages that are not associated with a claim (the primary object) are called <span class="e_-_emphasis">non-safe-ordered</span> messages.</div>
      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051850">salvage</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067382">Damaged property an insurer takes over to reduce its loss after paying a claim. Insurers receive salvage rights over property on which they have paid claims, such as badly-damaged cars. Insurers that paid claims on cargoes lost at sea now have the right to recover sunken treasures. Salvage charges are the costs associated with recovering that property.</a></div>
      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051852">schedule</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067397">A list of individual items or groups of items that are covered under one policy or a listing of specific benefits, charges, credits, assets or other defined items.</a></div>
      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1067393">self insurance</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067410">The concept of assuming a financial risk oneself, instead of paying an insurance company to take it on. Every policyholder is a self-insurer in terms of paying a deductible and co-payments. Large firms often self-insure frequent, small losses such as damage to their fleet of vehicles or minor workplace injuries. However, to protect injured employees, state laws set out requirements for the assumption of workers compensation programs. Self-insurance also refers to employers who assume all or part of the responsibility for paying the health insurance claims of their employees. Firms that self insure for health claims are exempt from state insurance laws mandating the illnesses that group health insurers must cover. </a></div>
      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1067406">slice mode</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1071636">Viewing a </a><span class="cv_-_computer_voice">PolicyPeriod</span> entity’s subobjects at a specific effective date; hiding entities that are not effective at that date.</div>
      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1071633">snapshot</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1113032">A saved duplicate of a claim taken at the time it was added to ClaimCenter.</a></div>
      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1113033">SOAP protocol</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1113034">The web services “request and response” protocol based on XML and typically implemented across the HTTP protocol. SOAP supports remote APIs in a platform-neutral and language-neutral way. Guidewire applications make extensive use of SOAP in its native web services features. For more information, refer to the World Wide Web Consortium at </a><span class="cv_-_computer_voice"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap" target="external_window">http://www.w3.org/TR/soap</a></span>. </div>
      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068525">split billing</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068526">A method to create a set of two or more receivables associated with a single transaction. For example, binding a workers’ compensation policy is a single transaction, but it might insure multiple locations. Further, the insured might want each location to be invoiced separately. This requires that the billing system split the total amount due into several invoices, each of which is to be tracked separately. Split billing does not relieve the main account holder from responsibility that the account remains in good standing. </a></div>
      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051858">SSL</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051859">Secure Sockets Layer, a specific type of encryption of a data stream. SSL is commonly used to encrypt HTTP connections, which are then referred to as HTTPS connections (and HTTPS URLs begin with “</a><span class="cv_-_computer_voice">https://</span>”).</div>
      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051860">staging table</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051861">A database table used temporarily to prepare data to import into an application’s database. Each application provides a table-based import interface for very high volume data import. Staging table import is typically used for large-scale data conversion. Used in ClaimCenter and BillingCenter for a variet of types of business data. For PolicyCenter, staging tables are only used for loading zone location data, </a><span class="s_-_strong">not</span> for administrative data or business data such as policies.</div>
      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1070441">statement bill</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1070443">A statement produced by BillingCenter for each producer when an agency bill relationship exists between the carrier and the producer. The monthly statement provides details of how much the producer expects to pay the carrier for income generated from a set of agency bill polices associated with the producer. </a></div>
      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1067955">stop loss</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069402">A provision in an insurance policy that cuts off an insurer’s losses at a given point. In effect, a stop loss agreement guarantees the loss ratio of the insurer. </a></div>
      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069401">Studio</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067953">The Guidewire administration tool for writing and managing rule sets, custom libraries, and Gosu classes. Guidewire Studio is a Java-based graphical interface and a development environment. Use it to create and manage application resources including Gosu rules and classes, PCF pages, workflows, entity names, display keys, plugins and message destinations, and SOAP web services.</a></div>
      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1067959">subrogation</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067449">The legal process by which an insurance company, after paying a loss, seeks to recover the amount of the loss from another party who is legally liable for it. For example, the carrier pays for repairs for a policyholder's car. It then tries to collect these costs from the insurance company of another person who was at fault in the accident. </a></div>
      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1212971">suspense item</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1212999">That part of a payment that is reserved for a specific policy before BillingCenter receives the policy details or the related charge.</a></div>
      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1212978">suspense payment</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1213064">A payment that is recorded in BillingCenter for an account or policy that does not yet exist in BillingCenter. </a></div>
      <h7 class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051868">system of record (SOR)</a></h7>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051869">Particularly used in the context of PolicyCenter, this term indicates which system contains the authoritative copy of a record. This can be either PolicyCenter or an external system that the application interfaces with. For example, if PolicyCenter is the system of record for a policy revision, then it has the authoritative copy. If PolicyCenter is not SOR, then it can have a copy of it, but assumes another system has the authoritative copy. This can be slightly different for various technical or business logic reasons. If it is </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">not</span> the SOR during a specific time period for a policy, PolicyCenter checks with the external policy administration system to get the most recent policy data. </div>
