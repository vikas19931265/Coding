# If you check base files into source control, define a regular expression
# pattern for paths of source control metadata files (using forward slashes)
# that the checksum ought to skip
# For example, for CVS, use the following:
# scm.regex = (^|.*/)CVS(/.*|$)
# Or, if you use SVN, use the following:
# scm.regex = (^|.*/)\.svn(/.*|$)
