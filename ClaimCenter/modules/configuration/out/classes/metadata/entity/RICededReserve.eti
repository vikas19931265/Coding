  <fulldescription>
    A subtype of &lt;code&gt;RITransaction&lt;/code&gt; that indicates an Amount of Reserves attributable to a particular RIAgreement.
    In other words, we have created Reserves, and if we pay out all that money, the reinsurer behind the RIAgreement will be obligated to
    reimburse us for this amount according to the RI treaty. It is a heads up about potential reinsurer liability.
    Like both types of RITransactions, RICededReserves behave similar to Reserve transactions as entities: they are immutable,
    and so multiple positive or negative transactions are created to adjust the total on a particular RICoding.
    To get the Total Ceded Reserves and other RI financials calculations,
    use the &lt;code&gt;FinancialsCalculationUtil&lt;/code&gt; class.
