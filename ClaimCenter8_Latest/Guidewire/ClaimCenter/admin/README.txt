WELCOME

Thanks for downloading Gosu.  You are using version 0.11-SNAPSHOT.


QUICK INSTALL

1. Confirm that you have Java version 1.7 (Sun/Oracle J2SE release 7) or
later on your computer. Gosu works with both the JRE version and the 
SDK version of Java. For Java downloads, visit http://java.com 

2. Expand the gosu.zip download file into its own directory.

3. Run the interactive shell by executing the platform-specific launch scripts in the /bin directory of the 
Gosu directory. For example, gosu.cmd for Windows users.

The Gosu Plugin for IntelliJ is the recommended way to use Gosu.
The plugin is hosted on the IntelliJ IDEA Plugin Repository and you can download it directly from within IntelliJ IDEA.
