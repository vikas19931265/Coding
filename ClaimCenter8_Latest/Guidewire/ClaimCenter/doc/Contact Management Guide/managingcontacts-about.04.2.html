    <blockquote>
      <h3 class="H1_-_Heading_1"><a name="1042162">Client Data Management</a></h3>
      <div class="B_-_Body"><a name="1550467">Client Data Management is available as an optional add-on module for Guidewire core applications that integrates and synchronizes client-related information across InsuranceSuite. Client Data Management supports a comprehensive view of the customer across core insurance processes through unifying the customer record. Some Client Data Management capabilities are supported by ContactManager. </a></div>
      <div class="B_-_Body"><a name="2072863">In conjunction with Guidewire InsuranceSuite core systems, Client Data Management enables you to manage customer contact data across underwriting, policy administration, billing, and claims processes. If you license the Client Data Management add-on module, you can install ContactManager and integrate it with PolicyCenter and with other InsuranceSuite core applications. With the applications integrated, Client Data Management supports your customer and agent interactions and can enable you to maintain data integrity across different systems.</a></div>
      <div class="B_-_Body"><a name="1550477">ContactManager is designed to be your system of record, the central repository for your customer data. This centralized repository stores a unique customer record and synchronizes updates across your policy, billing, and claims systems. </a></div>
      <div class="B_-_Body"><a name="1947697">Various types of users, such as billing specialists, underwriters, and agents, can edit customer information in their respective applications without having to navigate to another system. You can add new clients through PolicyCenter, see current client information for policies in ClaimCenter, make updates directly in ClaimCenter, and obtain the latest client data in BillingCenter. To aid data cleanup, duplicate contact detection identifies potential duplicate contacts resulting from creating new contacts and from changing existing contacts, and enables you to merge or override these contacts.</a></div>
      <div class="B_-_Body"><a name="1947553">ContactManager’s comprehensive customer view, available in PolicyCenter, enables service representatives to personalize interactions to match customers' needs. The search and auto-fill features support updating of contact records, and contact history tracks which updates have been made and provides visibility into previous customer interactions. Additionally, the PolicyCenter comprehensive view enables underwriters to find a customer’s policy, billing, and claim information in a single place. Underwriters no longer have to search for this information in multiple systems. And, to ensure that the proper controls are in place, user permissions dictate who can update contact information at various points in the lifecycle.</a></div>
      <h4 class="H2_-_Heading_2"><a name="1550484">PolicyCenter Role in Managing Client Data</a></h4>
      <div class="B_-_Body"><a name="2072880">With the Client Data Management module, after integrating PolicyCenter with ContactManager, PolicyCenter can store client data in ContactManager. Typically, you create a new client when you open an account or create a policy, or when you add contacts to an account or policy. Additionally, in the PolicyCenter </a><span class="ui_-_UI_element">Contact</span> tab, you can view information associated with a client, such as personal details like address, date of birth, and phone numbers. On the <span class="ui_-_UI_element">Account</span> tab, you can view contact information such as all accounts, policies, and work orders associated with the client. You can also see claims and billing information if you use ClaimCenter and BillingCenter with PolicyCenter or if you integrate this feature with another claim system or billing system.</div>
      <div class="N_-_Note">
        <span class="n_-_note">Note: </span><a name="2114137">While you can create a new client when you open an account or a new policy, the client data is not immediately stored in ContactManager. Contact data is stored in ContactManager only when you bind a policy or when you associate a contact with an account that has a bound policy. Additionally, contacts associated with reinsurance treaties or programs are also stored in ContactManager.</a></div>
      <div class="B_-_Body"><a name="1947796">Using the </a><span class="ui_-_UI_element">Contact</span> tab, you can create new contacts, search for existing contacts, select a recently viewed contact, and change contact information. PolicyCenter additionally enables you to work with contacts in its <span class="ui_-_UI_element">Account</span> and <span class="ui_-_UI_element">Policy</span> screens, where you can add, remove, and update contacts in various roles.</div>
      <div class="B_-_Body"><a name="1983132">All these contacts are stored locally with the associated account or policy. Contacts that were originally in ContactManager and contacts in accounts with at least one bound policy are linked to a central record in ContactManager. If you make changes to a linked contact, PolicyCenter saves these changes locally and to the central contact record in ContactManager.</a></div>
      <div class="B_-_Body"><a name="2041767">ContactManager also notifies PolicyCenter of any changes made to linked contacts outside PolicyCenter, such as a change originating in ClaimCenter when the client makes a claim. These notifications keep a contact’s records synchronized across all accounts, policies, work orders, and so on.</a></div>
      <div class="H3_-_Heading_3_outer" style="margin-left: 36pt">
        <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="" role="presentation">
          <tr style="vertical-align: baseline">
            <td>
              <h5 class="H3_-_Heading_3_inner" style="width: 18pt; white-space: nowrap"></h5>

          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <div class="B_-_Body"><a name="2041768">PolicyCenter has a feature that enables you to share the same address with more than one contact. When you share an address across contacts in PolicyCenter, the contact addresses continue to be stored separately, but PolicyCenter links them. However, in the other Guidewire applications, contact addresses are not linked. ContactManager stores each contact address as a separate, unlinked address. </a></div>
      <div class="B_-_Body"><a name="2045691">If you make a change to one of these addresses from ClaimCenter, BillingCenter, or ContactManager, there is a side effect in the base configurations. When ContactManager sends the changed contact address to PolicyCenter, PolicyCenter applies the change to the other addresses to which the original changed address is linked. PolicyCenter then sends these changed contact addresses back to ContactManager, and the result is that more than one contact gets an address change. There is no indication in ClaimCenter, BillingCenter, or ContactManager of this side effect—the linked addresses are changed automatically. You can configure the applications to behave differently. </a></div>
      <div class="B_-_Body"><a name="2045698">If you change a linked address in PolicyCenter, you have the option of linking or unlinking it from other contacts’ addresses. However, since this feature exists only in PolicyCenter, you do not have this option in the other Guidewire applications.</a></div>
      <h4 class="H2_-_Heading_2"><a name="2041769">ClaimCenter Role in Managing Client Data</a></h4>
      <div class="B_-_Body"><a name="1550511">ClaimCenter can receive client data from PolicyCenter when ClaimCenter requests policy information during claims processing. ClaimCenter also can receive client data updates from ContactManager when the information for a client stored in ContactManager changes. For example, a client might notify a PolicyCenter customer service representative that their address has changed. The customer service representative updates the client’s address, and PolicyCenter sends the change to ContactManager, which subsequently sends the change to ClaimCenter.</a></div>
      <div class="B_-_Body"><a name="1947971">Additionally, a client might notify a ClaimCenter customer service representative that their information has changed, such a change of phone number or address. The ClaimCenter customer service representative can change that information for the client in a claim, and then ClaimCenter can send the change to ContactManager. ContactManager then broadcasts the change to any Guidewire application that is integrated with ContactManager, such as PolicyCenter.</a></div>
      <h4 class="H2_-_Heading_2"><a name="2045636">BillingCenter Role in Managing Client Data</a></h4>
      <div class="B_-_Body"><a name="2045637">BillingCenter can receive client data from PolicyCenter when PolicyCenter sends billing information to BillingCenter. BillingCenter also can receive client data updates from ContactManager when the information for a client stored in ContactManager changes. For example, a client might notify a PolicyCenter customer service representative that their address has changed. The customer service representative updates the client’s address, and PolicyCenter sends the change to ContactManager, which subsequently sends the change to BillingCenter.</a></div>
      <div class="B_-_Body"><a name="2045644">Additionally, BillingCenter can send changes in client data to ContactManager. For example, a customer contacts a billing clerk to report a change of address.</a></div>
