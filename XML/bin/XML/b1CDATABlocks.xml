	CDATA BLOCKS
	==============
	
	we can include any text, any characters inside our XML document and parser will ignore it.
	The syntax for the CDATA block
		
		starts with a less then symbol followed by
		NOT, square bracket, and then text CDATA,
		followed by
		another square bracket.
		And it ends with two square brackets and a greater than symbol. 
		
Within  square bracket , we can type in any text and the XML parser will ignore it.

These CDATA blocks are usually used to give examples.

We can include an entire XML document here or we can include a piece of our XML document like the DateOfIssue 
in our case. 

We can have any number of CDATA blocks within our document anywhere but we cannot nest 
one CDATA block inside another CDATA block.
