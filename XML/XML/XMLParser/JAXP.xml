JAXP
==========


** If you are a Java developer, parsing an XML document for your Java application, you have a lot
of choice. Especially in the open source world,there are several parsers that are available and 
you can use any of these parsers from Apache, Oracle,weblogic, websphere or some other third party
which provides a new parser tomorrow.

** So if your architect decides that we have to switch from our current parser which we are 
using today to another new parser which came out in the market, we as developers cannot learn 
the API provided by each of these parsers.

** That is where JAXP comes into picture. JAXP which stands for Java API for XML Parsing,
is a standard from Oracle. Oracle defines an API which we as developers will learn.
And this API then is implemented by the parser implementors.

** So anyone who wants to create a XML parser for the Java world will implement the JAXP standard.

** The JAXP standard also defines a specification which is nothing but a set of rules
 or guidelines in plain english for these parser implementors, so that they will not be
 incompatible or they will be compatible with each other.

** So if we switch from one parser today to another parser tomorrow which implements the JAXP standard,
 we need not change anything in our code because we only use the JAXP API in our code.
  We just switch the underlying parser.

** The current version of JAXP is 1.6. Starting JAXP 1.4,it has the support for STAX pull based parsing. In the next few lectures,
