<!-- 
    Border Width
    =================

    It sets width of elementâ€™s border. We can set this property to thin, medium, thick, length in the form of px. 
Ex:- 
p {  border-style: solid; border-width: thick;}
p {  border-style: solid; border-width: 5px;}

We can give different border width to left and right, in same way as 
we did for border style.
