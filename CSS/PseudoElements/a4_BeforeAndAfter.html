<!-- 
    Before and After
    ===================

    This is used to generate dynamic content before or after the element.

    This is used to insert something before the content of each specified selector (each). 
    We use content property to specify the content to insert.

    Ex: - 
p::before { content: “ Geekyshows Says”; }

 <html>							
	<head>
		<title>Hello CSS</title>
		<style>
			p::after { content: " By Geekyshows ";
						color: red;
						}

                        /* 
                            in p tag after end of line put content "by geekyshows " and put color red in it.
                         */
