    Why set width in percentage
    ===========================

    If we set width in pixel then if the screen changes the size will still remain fixed. So in that case
    our data may get hidden.

    However setting it in percentage ensures that width is set based on the screen size on which the data
    is seen and hence the website becomes response.
