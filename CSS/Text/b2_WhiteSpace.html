<!-- 
    White Space
    ===============

It specifies how white space inside an HTML element is handled. 
    We can set this property to normal, pre, nowrap, pre-line or pre-wrap.

normal - Sequences of whitespace will collapse into a single whitespace. 
    Text will wrap when necessary. 

pre - Whitespace is preserved by the browser. Text will only wrap on line breaks. 
    It is just like the <pre> tag in HTML

nowrap - Sequences of whitespace will collapse into a single whitespace. Text will never wrap to
         the next line. The text continues on the same line until a <br> tag is encountered

pre-line - Sequences of whitespace will collapse into a single whitespace. Text will wrap 
         when necessary, and on line breaks
pre-wrap -
     Whitespace is preserved by the browser. Text will wrap when necessary, and on line breaks
