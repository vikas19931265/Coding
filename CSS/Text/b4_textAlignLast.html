<!-- 
    Text Align last
    =======================
    
    The text-align-last property specifies how to align the last line of a text. 
    The text-align-last property will only work for elements with the text-align property 
    set to "justify". We can set this property to auto, left, right, center, justify, start, or end.

p { text-align: justify;  text-align-last: right; }
