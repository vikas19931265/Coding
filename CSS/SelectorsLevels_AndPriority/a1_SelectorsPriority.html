<!-- 

    Selectors priority in order
    =============================

    1. ID
    2. CLASS
    3. Element.

 Priority of ID is going to come into picture only when we are having a parent tag. And inside the parent
 tag we want to refer some tag

 example , in div tag if we wan to refer p tag the
    
    #maindiv p   here priority comes in picture and addition of id and element priority is there

    to have a priority more then this we can write like #maindiv .class here overall combination of
    property will overtake the above priority.
