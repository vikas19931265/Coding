<!-- 
    Float
    =========

    Whenever we apply float to any of the child elements of the div tag. Then those child elements leave
    the parent element.

    Example if we have three div elements 1, 2 and 3 places one below the another.

    If we apply float right property to this then elements will leave the parent container and start floating
    to the right.

    However what ever elements which were appearing below it will take the positions left by the preivous 
    elements as result we will see a collapse.

    Therefore after applying float , we need to clear the float. Whatever elements below which start moving
    up we can apply clear left. But due to this the Dom will increase in size.

    So the trick to clear float is 

    #Container::after
    {
        content: " ";
        display:inline;
        clear :both
    }

        display: block;
        clear: both;
    }

        /* clear:left;
        We can do this to clear the elements which start collapsing due to float. But if
        we do this then it will become tedius as we need to apply it to number of elements so
        use the trick here.
