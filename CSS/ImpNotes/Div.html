<!-- 
    Div
    =======

    1. Div tag  is block level element meaning whatever content is in div tag will appear in new line
      . It does not mean that whenever element is inside the div tag will start appearing in new line.

    2. Example in div if we have 3 anchor tags then if we want the anchor tags to appear as block then
      we cant apply that on target div instead we have to apply on the anchor tag only.
