<!-- 

Column Span
================

This property is used to specify how many columns an element should span across. We can set this 
property to none (default) and all.
Ex: -
div { column-span: all;}

			div { columns: 3;
			}
			p { column-span: all;}

            /* 
                If we dont specify this then paragraph will get placed in the first column. We dont
                want that to happen and place it normally.
             */
