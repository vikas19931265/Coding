<!-- 
    Inline and block level
    ==========================

    Block-level Elements - A Block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full
     width available.
Ex: - 
<div> 
<h1>
 <p>

Inline Elements - An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as
 necessary.
Ex: - 
<span>
<a>
<img>
