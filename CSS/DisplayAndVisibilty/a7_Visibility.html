<!-- 
    Visibility
    =============

    This property is used to specify whether or not an element is visible.
     We can set this property to visible (default), hidden or collapse.

hidden - The element is invisible not removed.
collapse – This value is only used for table elements. collapse removes a row or column, but 
it does not affect the table layout. The space taken up by the row or column will be available 
for other content. If collapse is used on other elements, it will be treated as “hidden”.

Ex:- 
p { visibility: hidden;}


In case of visibility hidden , only the content is hidden but the space held by it is still there. But if display
is set to none then the space is also freed up.

        a href is inline tag . Content in this take as much space needed and we cant set the width.
