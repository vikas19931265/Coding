<!-- 
    Rule
    =========

    Whenever an inline element is followed by the block element it starts in new line and not in the line
    where the block level element was flowing.

    Example if we write a label after the paragraph, then paragraph is a block level element, and label is
    inline element and hence since label is followed by block level element therefore it comes in new line.
