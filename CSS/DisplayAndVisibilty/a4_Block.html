<!-- 
    Block
    ===========

    block – When we set this value, element always starts on a new line and takes up the full 
    width available (we can set width/height)



 -->


 <!-- 
    Inline
    ============

    inline – When we set this value, the element does not start on a new line and only takes up
    as much width as necessary (we can’t set width/height it won’t work)
