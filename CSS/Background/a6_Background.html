<!--     
    Background
    ================

     It works as a shorthand property for all background properties such as background-color,
     background-image, background-repeat, background-position and background-attachment etc. 
     
     It sets all these background properties in one declaration. 

     body {background: khaki url(image/geek.jpg) no-repeat}
