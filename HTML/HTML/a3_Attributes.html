<!-- 
    Attributes
    ====================

Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear 
on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: 
    
        - a name and a value, separated by an equals sign. 
 
<p lang = “en-us”>Paragraph in English </p>
 
The attribute name indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element's content.
It should be written in lowercase.

The value is the information or setting for the attribute. It should be placed in double quotes.

Different attributes can have different values.

In this example an attribute called lang is used to indicate the language used in this element. 
The value of this attribute on this page specifies it is in US English.

Note: - HTML5 allows you to use uppercase attribute names and omit the quote marks, but this 
is not recommended.
