<!-- 
    GET
    ========

GET sends the data as part of the URL.

Appends form-data into the URL in name/value pairs

The length of a URL is limited 2048 characters

Never use GET method if you have password or other sensitive information to be sent to the server.

Useful for form submissions where a user want to bookmark the result

GET is better for non-secure data, like query strings in Google

GET can't be used to send binary data, ex:-  images or word documents

<form action=“some.php” method = “GET”>

If we use an invalid value for the method attribute of the <form> tag, the browser will use the default value GET.

If we use GET in our form and try to go back using back button then no data is lost but
in POST the data is reset.

Caching is possible.

Data is visible to everyone from url.

Only ASCII chars are allowed.
