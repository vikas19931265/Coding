<!-- 
    POST
    ==========

HTTP POST requests supply additional data from the client (browser) to
the server in the message body. 

Appends form-data inside the body of the HTTP request (data is not shown is in URL)

The POST method does not have any restriction on data size to be sent.

Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked

The POST method can be used to send ASCII as well as binary data.
Ex:-  image and word documents etc

The data sent by POST method goes through HTTP header so security depends on HTTP protocol. By using Secure HTTP you can make sure that your information is secure.

POST is a little safer than GET because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs

<form action=“some.php” method = “POST”>

If we use GET in our form and try to go back using back button then no data is lost but
in POST the data is reset.

Caching is not possible.

Data is not visible to everyone from url.

ASCII+ Binary chars are allowed.
