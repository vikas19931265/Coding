<!-- 
    Enctype
    =========

    It specifies how the browser encodes the data before it sends it to the server. 

    application/x-www-form-urlencoded
        All characters are encoded before sent (spaces are converted to "+" symbols, 
        and special characters are converted to ASCII HEX values)

    multipart/form-data( frequent used)
        No characters are encoded. This value is required when you are using
        forms that have a file upload control

    text/plain
            Spaces are converted to "+" symbols, but no special characters are encoded
