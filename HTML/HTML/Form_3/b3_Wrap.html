<!-- 
    Wrap
    =============

    Wrap specifies two values only for text area input type. By default it is soft type. If it
    is soft type then the newlines in text area are not send to the server.

    However if the wrap type is hard type then the new lines in text area input are also send to the
    server.

    We should keep the wrap as hard only.
