<!-- 

    Allow top navigation
    ==========================

    Allows the iframe content to navigate its top-level browsing context

    There is property of anchor tag called target=top , if we specify the target like this then content to 
    which a href tag is pointing to will open in the full body.

    However if the link is inside the frame then . We need to allow this as one of property of iframe as well.

    so we need to first specify in a href target property as top and sandbox property as allow same origin
    + allow top navigation.

    Please note that if we are specifying top attribute for a href then its important that if its in frame
    then we must allow the top level navigation else it wont work.
