<!-- 
    Dialog tag
    ================
    Dialog – This tag defines a dialog box or window.
    It can be used to create popup dialogs. 
    
    It has one attribute-value pair which is open = “open” 
    and that means by default the data will be visible for users/viewers.
    
    By default it has False value so the data will be hidden.
	Ex: - <dialog>Click Here</dialog>
