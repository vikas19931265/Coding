<!-- 
    Class Attribute
    ==================

    The HTML class attribute makes it possible to define equal styles for elements with the same
     class name. 
     
    The class attribute specifies one or more class names for an element.

    The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. 
    However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to 
    HTML elements with a specified class.

    In HTML5, the class attribute can be used on any HTML element.


    Rules
    ===========

Must begin with a letter A-Z or a-z
A class name cannot start with a number
Must not contain any space characters
Can be followed by: letters (A-Za-z), digits (0-9), hyphens ("-"), and underscores ("_")
In HTML, all values are case-insensitive
