<!-- 
    HEAD
    ===========

    Before the <body> element you will often see a <head> element. This contains information about the page,
     rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser. 
     
    You will usually find a <title> element inside the <head> element. <head> is opening head tag and 
    </head> is closing head tag.
