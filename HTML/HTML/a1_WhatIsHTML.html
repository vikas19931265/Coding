HTML
===========

HTML provides a way of displaying Web pages with text and images or multimedia content. 
HTML is not a programming language, but a markup language.

An HTML file is a text file containing small markup tags. The markup tags tell the Web browser, such
as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome, how to display the page. An HTML file must have an htm or html 
file extension. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

Types of HTML Pages
======================

Static Pages 
--------------

Static pages, as the name indicates, comprise static content (text or images). So you can only see
the contents of a web page without being able to have any interaction with it.

Dynamic Pages 
--------------------
Dynamic pages are those where the content of the web page depend on user input. So interaction with the
user is required in order to display the web page. For example, consider a web page which requires a 
number to be entered from the user in order to find out if it is even or odd. When the user enters the 
number and clicks on the appropriate button, the number is sent to the web server, which in turn returns 
the result to the user in an HTML page.
