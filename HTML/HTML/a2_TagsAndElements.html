<!--
    Tags and Elements
    ========================

    A tag is a bit of text that acts as a point demarcation. To create a tag, HTML gives certain characters 
    special meaning: the angle brackets < and >.
    
    Putting characters within angle brackets creates a tag.
	        <h1> A heading </h1>

    Two tags
    =============================

    Start tag or opening tag and End tag or closing tag. An end tag always matches a start tag, except 
    that it has an extra forward slash after the opening angle bracket.

	        <h1> A heading </h1>

    Types of tags
    ===============================

    Container Tag – Which has opening and closing Tag.Ex: 
    
        -<html> ……. </html><head> ……. </head><body> ……. </body>

    Empty Tag – which has only opening tag.
    
        Ex: -<br><area><base><hr><img><input>

    Elements
    =================================

    The combination of a start and end tags define an element. Everything between the two tags 
    is referred to as the contents of the element.
	
		<h1> A heading </h1>

    -->
