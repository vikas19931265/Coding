<!-- 
    <HTML>
    =================    

<HTML> is a starting tag. To delimit the text inside, add a closing tag by adding a forward slash “/” 
to the starting tag. Most but not all tags have a closing tag. 

It is necessary to write the code for an HTML page between <HTML> and </HTML>. This <HTML> tells the
browser is 'this is the start of an HTML document' and </HTML> 'this is the end of an HTML document'.
