<p class="heading2">The Philosophy of TrainingApp</p>
<p class="body">The purpose of this document is to identify the philosophy behind TrainingApp. This document is being written for all
individuals who might make modifications to future builds of TrainingApp.</>

<p class="body">TrainingApp was created to solve two problems: (1) How can we create one set of materials that teaches all students
about the platform-level fundamentals of configuration, regardless of the product they are going to work with? (2) How can we provide
students with a learning environment which contains clean, clear examples of what they need to learn and avoids heavy usage of (fairly
non-intuitive) insurance business functionality?</>

<p class="body">The design of TrainingApp was directed by a specific set of philosophies. Future changes to TrainingApp should keep these
philosophies in mind. The philosophies are elaborated upon below in no particular order.</p>

<p class="heading2">TrainingApp Should Have Intuitive Business Functionality</p>

<p class="body">The purpose of TrainingApp is to teach people the fundemantals of configuration. It is not intended to teach them about
any real business functionality. Therefore, the business functionality of TrainingApp should be as intuitive as possible. Things should
work the way people would expect them to work. As much as possible, TrainingApp should avoid having business functionality that requires
a more-than-casual understanding of the insurance industry.</p>

<p class="heading2">TrainingApp Should Not Make Later Learning More Difficult</p>

<p class="body">TrainingApp contains functionality similar to what can be found in "real" Guidewire applications. When working with
TrainingApp, people will unintentionally be learning about real Guidewire functionality. Therefore, there shouldn't be anything in
TrainingApp which makes later learning more difficult. (For example, TrainingApp has notes functionality. Notes are created and viewed via
worksheets. This is because notes in real Guidewire apps are always done in worksheets. If TrainingApp notes were rendered in popups, it
would make later learning about "real" notes a bit harder.</p>

<p class="heading2">TrainingApp Should Not Look Like a Real Guidewire Application</p>

<p class="body">Guidewire Marketing wants to ensure that customers do not think that TrainingApp is a real Guidewire product which can
be purchased. Therefore, specific steps have been taken to prevent it from looking like a real Guidewire product. This includes: (1) Using
a product name which doesn't end in "Center". (This is why it isn't called TrainingCenter.) (2) Including UI elements which are obviously
incomplete and which have been labelled as such (such as the Interactions screen). (3) Removing as many references to ContactCenter as
possible.</p>

<p class="heading2">TrainingApp Needs One Clean Example Of All Fundamental Platform Functionality</p>

<p class="body">The primary purpose of TrainingApp is to provide one clean example of the platform functionality we teach. It is also
possible that we might change what we teach in the future, and it is possible that an instructor may want to point to an example of something
that isn't taught but which a student asks about or wants to be aware of. Therefore, there should be an example of all fundamental platform
functionality in TrainingApp. Furthermore, each example should be listed in the ExampleList box so that it is easy for people to identify
where the example is.</p>

<p class="body">The following detailed philosophies were used with each screen:
<ul>
<li>Except for the Details screen, all screens should display fields declared at the ABContact level. (This restricts the work with subtypes
and casting to a single screen and leaves the majority of the application free of that complexity.</li>
<li>All of the Person-level fields should be displayed on the Detail screen's Person Info card. All of the Company-level fields should be
displayed on the Detail screen's Company Info card. All of the Place-level fields should be displayed on the Detail screen's Place Info card.
This is to make it easier to determine where in the UI/PCF files to look for a given field declared below the ABContact level.</li>
</p>

<p class="heading2">TrainingApp Should Fully Adhere To Best Practices and Recommended Naming Conventions</p>

<p class="body">This includes: "customer" database extensions to the data model, PCF file names, PCF variable names, inlining/reuse of
PCF files, GScript coding standards, and business rule names.</p>

<p class="heading2">TrainingApp Should Avoid Having Complex Functionality If It Isn't Needed</p>

<p class="body">The purpose of TrainingApp is to be a simple example of platform functionality. Therefore, functionality which is unnecessarily
complex or difficult to understand should be avoided. For example, the Related Contacts functionality of ContactCenter was not copied over into
TrainingApp because it involves extensive work with bi-directional relationships, and it involves references to internal code.</p>
