/* What is Spring 
 ========================
 
 Spring is an open source, light weight, loosely coupled and dependency injection based Java framework to develop any type of applicaitons (core java, remoting, web applications 
 and enterprise applications etc).
 
 
 Features of Spring
 ========================

Spring is  open source s/w (will get the source code).

It is light weight s/w 

   -Servers are not required to execute the spring.
   -Size of the container
   -spring provides two light weight containers i.e BeanFactory and ApplicationContext. 

Spring is loosely coupled s/w
  
   -we can use few modules of spring or all the modules of spring to develop the application.
   -we can integrate spring with different other frame works. like struts with spring and spring with hibernate.

framework
   
   It is a reusable semi completed application that can be used to develop the applications.
   A set of well defined classes and interfaces are called framework.

 	
Using spring you can develop various types of application like core java, remoting, web applications,
enterprise applications etc.

It was initially written by Rod Johnson and was first released under the Apache in June 2003.

--version: spring 2.5 (compatable with jdk5 and above)
           spring 3.X (compatable with jdk5 and above)

Spring is a layer above your java and J2EE, but never spring is a replacement for the java and J2EE.

Spring provides the flexibulity to the developers, to develop the enterprise applications using POJOs.

Spring is organized in a modular fashion. Even though the number of modules are available, you have to worry about 
used module only, you can ignore the rest of the modules.

Spring handles the infrastructure so you can focus on your application.

Testing of the spring based application (Unit testing)is simple.

Spring's web framework is a well-designed web MVC framework, which provides a great alternative to web frameworks
such as Struts.
