/*
Path Variable (@PathVariable)
==================================


The @PathVariable annotation is used to extract the value from the URI. It is most suitable for the
RESTful web service where the URL contains some value.

Spring MVC allows us to use multiple @PathVariable annotations in the same method. 
A path variable is a critical part of creating rest resources.
