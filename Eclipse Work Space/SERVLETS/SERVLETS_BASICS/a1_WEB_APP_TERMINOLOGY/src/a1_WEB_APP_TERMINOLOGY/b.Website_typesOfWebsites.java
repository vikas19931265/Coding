Website

1. Website is a collection of related web pages that may contain text, images, audio and video. 

2. The first page of a website is called home page. Each website has specific internet address (URL) 
   that you need to enter in your browser to access a website.

3. Website is hosted on one or more servers and can be accessed by visiting its homepage using a computer network. 
   A website is managed by its owner that can be an individual, company or an organization.



A website can be of two types:

    Static Website
    Dynamic Website


Static website

Static website is the basic type of website that is easy to create. You don't need web programming and 
database design to create a static website.  Its web pages are coded in HTML.

The codes are fixed for each page so the information contained in the page does not change and it looks like a printed page.




Dynamic website

1. Dynamic website is a collection of dynamic web pages whose content changes dynamically. 
   
2. It accesses content from a database or Content Management System (CMS). 
    
3. Therefore, when you alter or update the content of the database, the content of the website is also altered or updated.

4. Dynamic website uses client-side scripting or server-side scripting, or both to generate dynamic content.

5. Client side scripting generates content at the client computer on the basis of user input. 
   

6. Client side scripts  are the scripts which run on the browser and processes requests without call to the server. example html, css, javascript are client side
   programming languages. Whatever coding we do with these langauges its effect will be visible in browser(client) , however this differs with the 
   server side programming like servlets/jsp as the coding and functionality is not visible to the client.This is something which happens at 
   the backend.


6. The web browser downloads the web page from the server and processes the code within the page to render information to the user.

7. In server side scripting, the software runs on the server and processing is completed in the server then plain pages are sent to the user.



Static vs Dynamic website


Static Website                                                                  Dynamic Website 	

Prebuilt content is same every time the page is loaded.                     Content is generated quickly and changes regularly.

It uses the HTML code for developing a website.                             It uses the server side languages such as PHP,SERVLET, JSP, and ASP.NET etc. for developing a website.

It sends exactly the same response for every request.                       It may generate different HTML for each of the request.

The content is only changes when someone publishes and updates the file     The page contains "server-side" code it allows the server to generate the unique content when the page is loaded.
(sends it to the web server).                                           

Flexibility is the main advantage of static website.                        Content Management System (CMS) is the main advantage of dynamic website.
