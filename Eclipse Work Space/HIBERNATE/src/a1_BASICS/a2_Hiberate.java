Hibernate
================

It is an opensource Object Relational Mapping tool. 

It is an opensource, lightweight, ORM tool for developing the database independent persistance logic in java, j2ee and framework based applications like standalone applications, 
web application, enterprise application.

Hibernate is a Java framework that simplifies the development of Java application to interact with the database. 
It is an open source, lightweight, ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool.

Hibernate implements the specifications of JPA (Java Persistence API) for data persistence.

Hibernate was developed by a team of java developers.

What is JPA?
=============================

Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java specification that provides certain functionality and standard to ORM tools. 
The javax.persistence package contains the JPA classes and interfaces.


Why will we go for Hiberante?
=====================================

-It is an opensource software(we can get the source code)

-light weight component.
    servers or containers are not required to execute the hibernate appl.

-It is an object relational mapping tool.

-It is compatable with any java, j2ee and framework based appl.

-Using Hibernate we can develop the DB independent persistance logic.

-It eliminates writing SQL queries to load, save, update and delete the objects. 

-It reduces the development time.

-HB supports POJO model programming (plain old java objects)

-HB allows to work with classes and objects instead of queries.

-HB supports all Create, Read, Update, Delete (CURD) operations

-HB gives the inbuilt support for connection pooling, by default hb software creates 20 connection objects.

-HB gives inbuilt support for transaction management.

-HB provides the primary key generator algorithms to generate primary key value to the primary key column.

-While inserting the data in the table, if the table is not available HB automatically creates a table.

-HB allows to work with third party vendor connection pool and server provide connection pool.

-Hibernate gives inbuilt support for Cache.
  There are two types of cache
  1.First level cache
  2.Second level cache.

-Hibernate gives inbuilt suport for inheritance.

-Hiberate supports associations(relations)(uni and bi directional)
	one - to - onene - to - many
	many - to - one
	many - to - many

-HB provides database independent query language i.e HQL(Hibernate query language)

-HB provides the flexibulity to excucute SQL queries(database dependent queries), this concept is called Native SQL.

-HB provides the flexibulity to call the stored procedures and functions.

-HB supports Collection mapping with the help of multiple collection tags. which are <list><set><map><bag>

-Hiberate gives exception traslator. it converts all the checked exceptions into unchecked exception.

-It supports wide range of databases such as Oracle, DB2, Sybase, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, HypersonicSQL, SAP DB and so on.

-latest versions of hibernate supports annotations.

-learn & apply the hibernate is easy.


Java version for HB
==========================

version: H.B 4.3.6(jdk5 and above)
	  	 H.B 3.6.0(jdk5 and above)
	  	 H.B 3.2.5(jdk4 and above)
