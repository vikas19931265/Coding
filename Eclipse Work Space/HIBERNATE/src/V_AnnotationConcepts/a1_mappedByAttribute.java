/*
mappedByAttribute( used always in bidirectional relationship)
=====================================================================

The mappedBy property is what we use to tell Hibernate which variable we are using to
represent the parent class in our child class.

mapped by parent reference in child table.. We keep this relationship and eliminate other relationships
