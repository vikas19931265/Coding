What is Components in angular???
=========================================

Angular working is completely based upon creating components. Components are created so that we can make
our complex application parts usable.

How to create components???
==========================================

We can create components at folder level, by right clicking and creating a file with the extension .ts.
This will be our new component , however we need to register the component in the module file as well.Also 
we will need to create the html files as well as style files for the component. Instead of doing this we can
do it using the command cli which will generate all the files needed for us.

We can supply the command "ng g c component_name" to create the component.
Once we create the component we will get the same list of file which are present in the app folder referred
to as the root folder.
