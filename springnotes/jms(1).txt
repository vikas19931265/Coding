spring JMS
----------
JMS is the standard API for asynchronus messaging. The client sends a request to Message Oriented Middleware(MOM) or a MessageServer.

The server consumes the message from the messageserver.

Message exchange between applications is provided by messaging servers.

Message Servers available like ActiveMQ, Jboss Messaging, MSMQ etc.

JMS provides a standard API to communicate with the messaging servers from the java aplications.

Java applications use JMS API to communicate with MOM.

NOTE: to execute JMS application(Main method based appl.) JBoss server is required. In the JBoss server we have to create Topic or Queue using following xml

<mbean code="org.jboss.jms.server.destination.TopicService"
name="jboss.messaging.destination:service=Topic,name=StockTopic" (line no 15)

above xml is available in following location.
jboss home/server/default/deploy/messaging/destinations-service.xml
In realword topic and queues are configured by the JMS Team or server admins.
