In spring application XML, if we need to initialize any bean before any other bean, depends-on do this job. 

For Example:




While creating bean we need to define depends-on attribute in bean. 
In the below example I have tried to show the working of depends-on. I have taken three bean A,B and C. 
I have implemented as 

B depends on C

A depends on B. 

First A will be initialized, and then B and then C. Find the example below.
