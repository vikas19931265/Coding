/* 
Array important points
============================

• JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0. 

• Using an invalid index number returns undefined. 

• It's possible to quote the JavaScript array indexes as well (e.g., geek['2'] 
instead of geek[2]), although it's not necessary.  

• Arrays cannot use strings as element indexes but must use integers. 

• There is no associative array in JavaScript. 
 geek[“fees”] = 200; 

 • No advantage to use Array Constructor so better to use Array Literal for 
creating Arrays in JavaScript.
