2       License Grant

2.1     The PDF Library product is licensed under exactly one of the following license types.
You agree to abide by the restrictions listed below.

(a) Trial Download License

Under this License the PDF Library may be downloaded for free and used by You for a limited
period for development and initial testing. The intention is to allow You time to assess
whether the PDF Library is suitable for their purposes. Under this License, the PDF Library
MAY NOT be used outside of a development environment.

(b) CPU License

Under this License You are granted the non-transferable, non-exclusive and perpetual right to
link the PDF Library to part of an applet or product running on (or in the case of
applets, downloaded from) a fixed number of production servers - defined as a computer run by
You excluding the Development Environment. The price of this License depends on the total
number of CPUs used by programs linked to the PDF Library, not the number of physical machines
used. This License may be transferred between servers, provided that the number of server CPUs
concurrently running products linked to the PDF Library never exceeds the number of server
CPUs specified in this License Agreement.

(c) OEM License

(i) Under this License You are granted the global, irrevocable, non-transferable,
non-exclusive and perpetual right to link the PDF Library to products requiring the PDF
library as an integral part, and that are developed, marketed and distributed by You and
distributed to third parties. The price of this License is based on the total number of
products distributed that are linked to the PDF Library, including any non-free updates to
the Product. The products distributed by You and linked to the PDF Library must add
considerable functionality to the PDF Library. Programs, which in essence mimic the
functionality of the PDF Library, or a subset thereof, are expressly prohibited under this
License.

(ii) This License includes the right for You to sub-license to third parties the
right to use this PDF Library only as part of the product developed by You - any other use
will require a separate license agreement with the Licensor. This License specifically
excludes use which falls under the category of a "CPU License" as defined above.

(iii) You undertake and warrant that you will not reveal, divulge or disclose to any third
party whatsoever the key code of this OEM License and further undertake to embed the OEM key
code in a secure manner.

(d) Annual Subscription License

Under this License You are granted the non-transferable and non-exclusive right to link the
PDF Library to a website or intranet. The price of this License depends on the total number
of CPUs used by programs linked to the PDF Library, not the number of physical machines
used. Fees for this License are renewed annually as a subscription. This License may be
transferred between servers, provided that the number of server CPUs concurrently running
products linked to the PDF Library never exceeds the number of server CPUs specified in
this License Agreement.

2.2     Development License

In addition to the License grants defined in 2.1, an annual charge may apply for running
the PDF Library in a Development Environment. This charge will apply only while the Product
is "live" - it specifically excludes the period when the product is under development and
has not yet been released.


3       Copyright

3.1     You acknowledge that no title to the intellectual property in any part of the Product
is transferred to You. You further acknowledge that title and full ownership rights to the
Product will remain the exclusive property of The Licensor and its suppliers and You will
not acquire any rights to the Product except as expressly set out in this Agreement. You agree
that any copies of any part of the Product will contain the same proprietary notices which
appear on and in the Product (as appropriate).

3.2     The Licensor warrants that all intellectual property rights in the Product either
reside with itself or its suppliers and that the Licensor is entitled to enter into this
Agreement and that use of the Product by an Authorised User is not in breach of any third
party's intellectual property rights. The Licensor agrees to indemnify You against all costs,
claims and liabilities arising from breach of this warranty provided that you immediately
notify the Licensor about any alleged breach and render all reasonable assistance to the
Licensor (at the cost of the Licensor) in defending any such claim.

3.3     You agree that this License does not include ownership of the source-code for the PDF
library, which may be covered by a separate license.

Recipient agrees that it will not use the Confidential Information (except as authorised in

written consent of the Disclosing Party. For the purpose of this Agreement, "Confidential
Information" shall mean all information about or belonging to the Disclosing Party that is not

independently developed by the Recipient without breach of this Agreement; or (iv) is subject

requirement, or order, to permit the Disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity to object to
the subpoena, requirement, or order and to allow the Disclosing Party the opportunity to seek
a protective order or other appropriate remedy. The obligations described in this paragraph
shall survive termination of the Agreement.

11.2    Either party shall have the right to publish, cause to have published, or use the name

your computer system(s) and remove all license keys.

will not prevent it from doing so later in respect of a particular breach or any future
breach.

13.2    Any notice served pursuant to this Agreement must be in writing, addressed to a party
at the last known address for that party and sent by:

addressed) be deemed received upon the signature of the addressee; or
(b) by hand

13.3    Neither party will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement insofar as that
breach is a result of an act of event beyond that party's reasonable control but if that
situation arises, the relevant party will make reasonable efforts to overcome that problem
as soon as reasonably possible.
