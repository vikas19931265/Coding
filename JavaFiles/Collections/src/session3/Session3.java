/* Collection

1. If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity then we should
   for go for collection.( dont say collections as its a utility class).

2. Collection interfaces defines the most commmon methods which are applicable for any collection Object.


      boolean add( Object o)
      boolean addAll(Collection c)
      boolean remove(Object o) 
      boolean removeAll(Collection c)
      boolean retainAll(Collection c)--> to remove all Objects except those present in c
      void clear();
      boolean contains(Object o)
      boolean containsAll(Collection c)
      boolean isEmpty();
      int Size();
      Object[] toArray();
      Iterator iterator();
      boolean equals( Object 0);
      int hashcode();


3. There is no concrete class which implements Collection interface directly.
