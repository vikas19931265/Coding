/*

Limitations of Enumerations.

1. We can apply enumeration concept only for the legacy classes and it is not a universal 
   cursor.

2. By using enumeration we can get only read access but we cannot perform any kind of 
   remove operation.

3. To overcome above limitations we should go for iterator.
