/*
Difference between Arrays And collections.


    Arrays                                                           Collections                                                                   

1. Arrays are fixed in Size that is once we                 Collections are Growable in nature             
   Create an array we cannot increase or decrease           that is based on our requirement we can increase
   the size based on our requirement.                       our decrease the size of the array

2. With respect to memory arrays are not                    With respect to memory collections are recommanded to be 
   recommanded to use                                       used.    


3. With respect to performance arrays are recommanded       with respect to performance collections are not recommanded to be
   to be used.                                              used.    


4. Arrays can hold only homogenous data type elements.      Collections can hold both homogenous as well as heterogenous elements.

5. There is no underline data structure for arrays          Every Collections class is implemented based on some standard data structure and hence
   and hence readymade methods support is not available     for every requirement ready made methods support is available . Being a programmer we can use
   for them. For every requirement we have to write the     these methods directly and we are not responsible to implement those methods.
   code explicitly which increases of the programming.


6. Arrays can hold both primitives and Objects              Collections can hold only Object types but not primitive types.
