The underline data strucuture for ArrayList is


1)   Resizable Array or growable Array

2)   Duplicates allowed.

3)   ArrayList can hold heterogenous Objects

        Except in TreeSet and TreeMap everywhere heterogenous Objects are allowed

4)  Insertion order is preserved.

5)  null insertion is possible




The important points about Java ArrayList class are:

    Java ArrayList class can contain duplicate elements.
    
    Java ArrayList class maintains insertion order.
    
    Java ArrayList class is non synchronized.
    
    Java ArrayList allows random access because array works at the index basis.
    
    In Java ArrayList class, manipulation is slow because a lot of shifting needs to 
    be occurred if any element is removed from the array list.

    Java ArrayList implements Serializable and Cloneable marker interfaces.
