Types of Java Applications
-------------------------------------

1. Java applications can be categorized into two categories

        1. Standalone applications

                a. CUI applications

                b. GUI applications



        2. Enterprise applications 

                a. Web applications

                b. Distributed applications



Standalone applications
--------------------------------------------------

    1. Standalone applications are applications prepared inside a single computer and executed 
       in the same computer only.

    2. These are the applications which are designed without using the client-server architecture.

    3. Here in this case the distribution logic is not spread across several computers.



CUI applications( Type of standalone application)
---------------------------------------------------------

    CUI applications are standalone applications which will be designed in such a way to take
    input and to provide output by using the command prompt only. Here the command prompt is acting
    as the user interface and is able to support the character data only.


    Java applications which are designed based on the command prompt that is character interface is called
    as the the CUI applications.


GUI applications
-------------------------------------------------------------

    GUI Applications are the standalone applications, which will be designed in such a way to take input
    and to provide output by using a collection of Graphic component, where the collection of Graphic
    components is acting as an user interface and is able to support GUI component.


    Application which will be design on the basis of Graphical user interface is called as GUI Application.




Enterprise Applications
--------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the java applications, which will be designed on the basis of Client-Server Architecture.
There are 2 types of Enterprise applications.

1. Web Applications
2. Distributed Applications




Web Applications
--------------------------------------------


    Client(browser)-------------------network-----------------Server(Application)

    In web applications client is always browser and JVM or java programs are present at the server side only


Remote Based Distributed applications
-------------------------------------------------------

    client(Java app/java code)-------------------network-----------server machine/remote machine(java app)


    In this case client is not browser but instead it is a java application only. So in this case in both the sides 
    we will be having java applications.
