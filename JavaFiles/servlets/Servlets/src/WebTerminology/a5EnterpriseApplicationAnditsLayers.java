ENTERPRISE:
=======================


Enterprise is a business organization, a group of organizations running under a single label.

ENTERPRISE APPLICATION:
=================================
It is a software application, which will be designed for a particular enterprise in order to simplify the
internal business processing.

To design enterprise applications we have to use the following 3 layers.

    User Interface Layer
    Business Processing Layer
    Data Storage and Access Layer


1. USER INTERFACE LAYER:
===============================

User Interface Layer is the top most layer in enterprise application, it will provide starting point for the
customers to interact with enterprise application.

The main purpose of User Interface Layer in enterprise applications is

a.To improve look and feel for the enterprise applications.

b. To accept user details in order to execute server side application.

c. To provide very good environment for client side validations with Javascript functions..

d. To specify different types of requests at client browser like get, post, head and so on.

To prepare User Interface Layer in enterprise application we will use a separate logic is called as
Presentation Logic.

To prepare presentation logic in enterprise applications we have to use technologies like AWT,
SWING, HTML, JSP, Velocity and so on.



2. BUSINESS PROCESSING LAYER:
=======================================

a. Business Processing Layer is the heart of the enterprise application, it will provide very good
   environment to define and execute all the business rules and regulations which are required by the
   client.

b.  To prepare Business Processing Layer in enterprise application we will use a separate logic is called as
    Business Logic.

c. In enterprise application development, to prepare Business logic we have to use technologies like
   Servlets, Jsp's, JavaBeans, EJBs and so on.



3. DATA STORAGE AND ACCESS LAYER:
===============================================

a.  This layer is the bottom most layer in enterprise applications.

b.  The main purpose of this layer is to provide data persistency in enterprise application.
    Data Storage and Access Layer will provide very good environment to provide the basic database
    operations(CRUD) as per the enterprise application requirement.

c.  To prepare Data Storage and Access Layer we will use a separate logic called as Persistence
    Logic.

d.  In enterprise application development, to prepare persistence logic we have to use technologies like
    Jdbc, EJB-Entity Beans Hibernate, JPA and so on.
