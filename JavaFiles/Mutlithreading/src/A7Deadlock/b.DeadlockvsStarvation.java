Deadlock vs Starvation.
==========================================

Long waiting of a thread where waiting never ends is called as Deadlock.

Whereas long waiting of a thread where waiting ends at certain point of time is called "Starvation"


For example low priority threads have to wait until completion of all the high priority threads. It 
may be long waiting but ends at certain point , which is nothing but starvation.
