/*
Attribute in Servlet
================================================================================================

An attribute in servlet is an object that can be set, get or removed from one of the following scopes:

request scope
session scope
application scope

The servlet programmer can pass informations from one servlet to another using attributes. 
It is just like passing object from one class to another so that we can reuse the same object again and again.
