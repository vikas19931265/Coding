/*
Difference between normal import and static import.??

Answer) We can use normal import to import classes and interfaces of a particular package. Whenever
        we are using normal import it is not required to use fully qualified name and we can use the short
        names directly.

        We can use static import to import static members of a particular class or interface. Whenever
        we are writing static import it is not required to use class name to access the static members
        and we can access directly.
