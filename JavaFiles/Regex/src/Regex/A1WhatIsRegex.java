Regular Expression
==============================================================

If we want to represent a group of Strings according to some particular pattern then
we should go for the Regular expressions.

Example1: We can write  a regular expression to represent all valid mobile numbers

Example2: We can write a regular expression  to represent all mail IDs.


The main important application areas of regular expressions are

1. To develop validation frameworks.

2. To develop pattern matching applications(ctrl f in windows, and grep in unix)

3. To develop translators like assemblers , compilers, interpreters etc.

4. To develop digital circuits.

5. To develop communication protocols like TCP/IP, UDP etc.
