<!-- 
Parsers
==========

** When we build software applications to read and write XML documents either as a configuration file or
to exchange data with other software applications,

** we as developers need not deal with the low level API to read that XML line by line and then
 check for the well-formedness and validation and all that. We will simply use a XML parser to read
  and write the XML document in an easy fashion. 
  
** An XML parser is a software that provides an API, Application Programmers Interface that
 we as developers will use when we build our application.And it makes our job as a developer very 
 easy to read and write the XML document.It can also check for the well-formedness of the XML which 
 it does and then can also validate the XML against a schema file if it has one.

** There are three types of parser APIs or parsers.

 Starting with DOM which is a tree based parser,
 SAX which is a event based parser
 and finally the most recent, 
 STAX which is a pull based parser.
