<!-- 
DOM
==================

** In this lecture you will master the concepts of the DOM parser. 
DOM stands for Document Object Model. As the name itself says, a DOM parser loads the entire 
XML document into the system's memory and then it gives us hierarchical access to the entire XML
document. 

** The advantages of a DOM parser or when to use a DOM parser is when we need to access the
 different parts of the XML in our application or in our program at the same time.

** Also it is hierarchical. That is, we access the parent element first and then we go through 
all the child elements within that element.

** The disadvantages of DOM parser or when not to use the DOM parser is when you have strict memory
 issues. That is, when you are using mobile devices or whenever you have whenever you don't have a 
 lot of memory,you cannot load the entire XML document into the memory because of space reasons.That is when you shouldn't use a 
 DOM parser. The DOM standard is defined by World Wide Web Consortium.
