	Attributes in xml
	=========================
	
Elements in a XML document might feel lonely and get bored if they don't have any company.
That is where attributes come into picture.

You'll learn about attributes by using the Photo field from our requirement.

The Photo has to include the location of the driver's photograph on the server.
So to do that, we'll add a Photo element,

And instead of having a textual value of the location we can simply use a location attribute. 
And this location can be some server name, IP address of a server, slash the filename.

Attributes unlike elements, they don't carry the actual data but they qualify the data and 
add some special meaning to the elements.

Another example could be, we can have a unique ID or we can have a status on the drivers license which tells 
whether it's a active or whether its canceled or whether it was suspended for

So this status attribute here, qualifies this entire DriversLicense but it doesn't directly carry
any data that belongs to the DriversLicense itself.

To summarize, attributes are name value pairs. The names always follow the same naming conventions as the 
elements and the values should always be inside double quotes or single quotes.
