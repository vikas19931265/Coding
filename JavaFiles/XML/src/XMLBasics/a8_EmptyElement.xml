	Empty elements
	===============
	
Elements that do not enclose any child elements or text data are called empty elements. In our DriversLicense.xml,
the element Photo does not include any textual data or child elements of its own. It's empty.

It simply has attribute on it called location which tells about the location of the photograph. That is why they are useful.

They add value only through their attributes. But these elements should always be closed.
