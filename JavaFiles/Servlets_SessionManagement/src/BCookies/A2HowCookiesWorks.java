How Cookie works
======================

By default, each request is considered as a new request. 

In cookies technique, we add cookie with response from the servlet.

So cookie is stored in the cache of the browser. 

After that if request is sent by the user, cookie is added with request by default. Thus, we recognize the user as the old user.
