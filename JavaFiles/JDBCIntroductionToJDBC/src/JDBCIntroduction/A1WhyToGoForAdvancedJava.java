ADVANCED JAVA
===========================================

◈ With Core Java knowledge we can develop Stand Alone Applications.

The Applications which are running on a Single Machine are called Stand Alone Applications.
Eg: Calculator, MS Word
Any Core Java Application

◈ If we want to develop Web Applications then we should go for Advanced Java.

    The Applications which are providing Services over the Web are called Web Applications.
    Eg: durgasoftvideos.com, gmail.com, facebook.com, durgasoft.com

In Java we can develop Web Applications by using the following Technologies...
◈ JDBC
◈ Servlets
◈ JSP's

◈ Where ever Presentation Logic is required i.e. to display something to the End User then we
  should go for JSP i.e. JSP meant for View Component.

eg: display login page
display inbox page
display error page
display result page
etc..

◈ Where ever some Processing Logic is required then we should go for Servlet i.e. Servlet meant for
Processing Logic/ Business Logic. Servlet will always work internally.

Eg: Verify User
Communicate with Database
Process End User's Data
etc..

◈ From Java Application (Normal Java Class OR Servlet) if we want to communicate with Database
then we should go for JDBC.
Eg: To get Astrology Information from Database
    To get Mails Information from Database


◈ In Java there are 3 Editions are available
1. Java Standard Edition (JSE | J2SE)
2. Java Enterprise Edition (JEE | J2EE)
3. Java Micro Edition (JME | J2ME)

◈ JDBC is the Part of JSE

Servlets and JSP's are the Part of JEE

Current Version of JSE is Java 1.8
Current Version of JDBC is: 4.2 V
Current Version of JEE is 7.0
Current Version of Servlets: 3.1 V
Current Version of JSP is: 2.3 V
Current Versions Are:
JDBC 4.2 V
Servlets 3.1 V
JSP's 2.3 V
