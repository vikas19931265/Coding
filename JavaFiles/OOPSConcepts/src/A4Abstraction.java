Abstract class in Java
===========================


A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java.
It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).

Abstraction in Java
=========================

Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

Another way, it shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details, 
for example, sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the 
internal processing about the message delivery.

Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.

Ways to achieve Abstraction
===============================

There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java

Abstract class (0 to 100%)
Interface (100%)
