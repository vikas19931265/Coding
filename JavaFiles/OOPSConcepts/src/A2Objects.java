Object
===============


Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example a chair, pen, 
table, keyboard, bike, etc. It can be physical or logical.

An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and 
takes up some space in memory. Objects can communicate without knowing the details of 
each other's data or code. The only necessary thing is the type of message accepted and 
the type of response returned by the objects.

Example: 
=============

A dog is an object because it has states like color, name, breed, etc. as well
as behaviors like wagging the tail, barking, eating, etc.
