/*

1.JdbcRowSet(I):
========================================

-> It is exactly same as ResultSet except that it is scrollable and updatable.

-> JdbcRowSet is connected and hence to access JdbcRowSet compulsary Connection must be
   required.

-> JdbcRowSet is non serializable and hence we cannot send RowSet object across the network.
