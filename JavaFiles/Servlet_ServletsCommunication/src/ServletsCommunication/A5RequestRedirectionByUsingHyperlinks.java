/*

Request Redirection using hyperlinks
====================================================================================

In this mechanism, when we send a request to first application some resources will be executed and
generated an hyper link at client browser as a response.

By getting hyper link at client browser we have to click on it and we have to send another request to
the new web application.

By executing some resources at new web application the required response will be generated to client
browser.

DRAWBACK:
==================================

In this Request Redirection mechanism, user may or may not click the generated hyper link at client
browser after sending first request. So that this mechanism wonâ€Ÿt provide guarantee to achieve Request
Redirection.
