WSDL
==========

WSDL breaks down web services into three specific, identifiable elements that 
can be combined or reused once defined.

The three major elements of WSDL that can be defined separately are âˆ’

Types
Operations
Binding

A WSDL document has various elements, but they are contained within these three main elements, which can be 
developed as separate documents and then they can be combined or reused to form complete WSDL files.
