What is the difference between write(100) and print(100)???
=========================================================================

In the case of write(100) the corresponding character "d" will be added to the file.
But in the case of print(100) , the int value 100 will be added to the file directly.



Most enhanced reader and writer
=======================================================

The most enhanced writer to write character data to the file is PrintWriter whereas
the most enhanced reader to read the character data from the file is BufferedReader.



In General we can use readers and writers to handle character data(text data),
whereas we can use Streams to handle binary data( like images , pdf files, video files.
audio files etc).


We can use OutputStream to write binary data to the file. InputStream can be used to
read the binary data from the file.
