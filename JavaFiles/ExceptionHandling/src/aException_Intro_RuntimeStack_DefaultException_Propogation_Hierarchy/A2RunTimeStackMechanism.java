/* Run time Stack Mechanism.


1. For every thread JVM will create a run time stack. Each and every method call
   performed by that thread will be stored in the corresponding stack.

2. Each entry in the stack is called as Stack Frame or Activation Record.

3. After completing every method call the corresponding entry from  the stack will be
   removed.

4. After completing all the method calls the stack will become empty and the empty stack
   will be destroyed by the JVM just before  terminating the thread.

note

    Donâ€™t confuse between main thread and main method. Both of them are different terms.

1.Run time stack            2. main() method added to stack
for main thread

|______|                    |doMoreStuff()  |
|doStuf|                    |doStuff()      |-------> Each entry is called as Stack Frame/Activation Record.
|main()|                    |main()________ |


3.Add doStuff()                 4.Add doMoreStuff method to
  method to stack                 stack.



|______|                    |           |
|doStuf|                    |           |
|main()|                    |main()_____|


4. doMoreStuff() method         5.doStuff() method execution finish without
   execution completes             errors.
   without errors.

6. Finally stack becomes empty after main()
   completes and JVM destroys it.
