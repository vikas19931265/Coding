  /*
Polymorphism
==========================

Same name with different forms is the concept of the polymorphism.

Example 1
==================

    We can use abs() method for int type, long type, float type etc.

Example
        
    1. abs(int)
    2. abs(long)
    3. abs(float)

Example 2
=================

    We can use parent reference to hold any child objects.

    We can use the same list references to hold ArrayList object, LinkedList object,
    Vector object or Stack object.

Example

    1. List l = new ArrayList();
    2. List l = new LinkedList();
    3. List l = new Vector();
    4. List l = new Stack();

Pillars of OOPS
==================

                OOPS
                    |
                    |---------- Inheritance (Reusability)                        
                    |            
                    |-----------Polymorphism( Flexibility)
                    |    
                    |-----------Encapsulation (Security)

Inheritance talks about reusability, polymorphism about flexibility and encapsulation about security.



Beautiful Defination of polymorphism
======================================

A boy starts love with word friendship, but girl ends love with the same word friendship
word is the same but with different attitudes. This concept is nothing but known as
polymorphism.
