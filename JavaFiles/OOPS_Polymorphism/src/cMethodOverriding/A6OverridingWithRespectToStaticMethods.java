/*

1. We canâ€™t override a static method as non static. Infact a static method can never be overridden but method hiding is possible.

2. If we try to do so, then we will get compile time error.

3. Similar to point 1 we cannot override a non static method as static.

    This is invalid as we are trying to override a static method which is at class
    level inside the instance method which is at the object level.
    
    error: m1() method in c cannot override m1() in P, overridden method is static.

    This is also invalid as we cannot override a non static method to static method.
