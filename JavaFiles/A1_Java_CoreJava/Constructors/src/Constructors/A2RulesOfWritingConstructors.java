/*

Rules of writing a constructor
===========================================

1. Name of the class and name of the constructor must be matched.

2. Return type concept not applicable for constructor not even void also. 

3. By mistake if we are trying to declare return type for the constructor.
   Then we wont get any compile time error because compiler treats it as a method.
   
4. Hence it is legal( but stupid) to have a method whose name is exactly same as
   class name
