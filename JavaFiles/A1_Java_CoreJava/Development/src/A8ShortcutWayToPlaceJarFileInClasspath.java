Note

To place the .class file in the Classpath just the location is enough but to make
jar file available in the Classpath location is not enough, compulsory we have to 
include name of the jar files also

Shortcut way in order to place the jar file into the classpath.
===========================================================================

If we place the jar file in the following location then all the classes and interfaces
present inside the jar file by default will be available to java compiler and the
JVM. We are not required to set up the classpath explicitly.


JDK
    JRE
        lib
            ext
                *.jar
