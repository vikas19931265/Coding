                |
                |   ---------JRE-------     +   -----developement tools
                |   |
                |   |   JVM+library classes
                |   |
                    |


JDK= JRE + Development tools

JRE= JVM + library classes.


note
===================

On the developers machine we have to install JDK whereas on the client machine
we have to install JRE.
