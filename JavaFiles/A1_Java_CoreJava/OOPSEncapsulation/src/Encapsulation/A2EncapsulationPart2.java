Encapsulation
=====================

The process of binding data and corresponding methods into a single unit is called
as encapsulation.


If any java class follows data hiding and abstraction then such type of class is 
called as encapsulated class.


                ***Encapsulation=Data Hiding+ Abstraction

In encapsulation every data member should be declared as private and for every member
we maintain a separate getter and setter method.


The main advantages of encapsulation are
=========================================

1. We can achieve security.
2. Enhancement will become very easy.
3. It improves maintainability and modularity of the application.
4. It provides flexibility to the user to use the system very easily.


The main disadvantage of encapsulation is that it increases the length of the code
and slows down the execution.
