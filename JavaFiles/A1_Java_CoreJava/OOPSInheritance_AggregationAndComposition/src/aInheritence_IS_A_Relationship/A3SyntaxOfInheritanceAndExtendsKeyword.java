/*

Syntax of Inheritance and Extends Keyword
==============================================

The extends keyword indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class. 
The meaning of "extends" is to increase the functionality.

In the terminology of Java, a class which is inherited is called a parent or superclass, 
and the new class is called child or subclass.

    //extends is the keyword which is used to get inheritance feature.
