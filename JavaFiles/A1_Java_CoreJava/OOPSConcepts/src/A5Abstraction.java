Abstraction in java
========================

Hide internal implementation and just highlight the set of services is called as
abstraction.

By using abstract classes and interfaces we can implement abstraction




Example
==========

By using ATM GUI screen bank people are highlighting the set of services what they
are offering without higlighting the internal implementation.


The main advantages of Abstraction are
========================================

1. We can achieve security as we are not highlighting our internal implementation
   (that is outside person is not aware about the internal implementation).

2. Enhancement will become very easy because without affecting end user we can
   able to perform any types of changes in our system.

3. It provides more flexibility to the end user to use the system easily.

4. It improves the maintainiblity of the application.

5. It improves modularity of the application.

6. It improves easyness to use the system.

7. By using interfaces(GUI screens) we can implement abstraction.
