/*

Data Hiding
=========================

Our internal data should not be accessible directly , that is outside person should
not be able to access our data directly.


By using private modifier in our variables we can implement data hiding.


Example
=============

class Account
{
    private double balance;
    
    ---------------------

    --------------------

}

After providing proper username and password only, we can access our account information.

The main advantage of data hiding is security.

Note
========

Recommend modifier for the data members is private.
