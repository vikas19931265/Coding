/*
Difference between Arrays And Collection.
================================================================================


    Arrays                                                           Collection.                                                                   
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Arrays are fixed in Size that is once we                 Collections are Grow able in nature             
   create an array we cannot increase or decrease           that is based on our requirement we can increase
   the size based on our requirement.                       our decrease the size of the array.

2. With respect to memory arrays are not                    With respect to memory collections are recommended to be 
   recommended to use.                                      used.    


3. With respect to performance arrays are recommended       with respect to performance collections are not recommended to be
   to be used.                                              used.    


4. Arrays can hold only homogeneous data type elements.      Collections can hold both homogeneous as well as heterogeneous elements.

5. There is no underline data structure for arrays          Every Collections class is implemented based on some standard data structure and hence
   and hence ready made methods support is not available     for every requirement ready made methods support is available . Being a programmer we can use
   for them. For every requirement we have to write the     these methods directly and we are not responsible to implement those methods.
   code explicitly which increases programming 
   complexity.


6. Arrays can hold both primitives and Objects              Collections can hold only Object types but not primitive types.
