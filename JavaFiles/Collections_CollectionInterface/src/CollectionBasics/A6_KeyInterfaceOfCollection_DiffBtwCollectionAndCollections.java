Collection(Interface)
=================================

1. If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity then we should go for 
   collection.

2. Collection interface defines the most common methods which are applicable for any collection object.

3. In general collection interface is considered as root interface of the collection framework.

4. There is no concrete class which implements collection interface directly. Ex List is interface extending Collection
   and ArrayList implements it.




What is the difference between Collection and Collections??
============================================================


Collection is an interface , if we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity
then we should go for collection.

Collections is an utility class present inside java.util package to define several utility methods
for Collection objects( like sorting , searching , etc)  example Collections.sort(l) where l is arraylist Object.
