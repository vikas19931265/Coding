Introduction
--------------------

1. For writing any java program whether it is simple or complex. The most commonly required classes and interfaces
   are grouped into a separate object which is nothing but java.lang package.


2. We are not required to import java.lang package explicitly because all the classes and interfaces present in 
   lang package are by default available to every java program.
