What is Internationalisation???
==================================


The process of designing the web applications in such a way that which provides support
for various countries and various languages and various currencies automatically without
performing any change in the application  is called Internationalization(I18N). 

For example if the request is coming from India then the response should be in 
India people understandable form.

And if the request is coming from US then the response should be in US people understandable
form.



We can implement internationalization by using the following three classes.

1. Locale.
2. NumberFormat.
3. DateFormat.
