Transaction Properties:
==============================

Every Transaction should follow the following four ACID properties.

1. A ➔ Atomiticity

        Either all operations should be done or None.

2. C ➔ Consistency(Reliabile Data)

    It ensures bringing database from one consistent state to another consistent state.

3. I ➔ isolation (Sepatation)

    Ensures that transaction is isolated from other transactions

4. D ➔ Durability

    It means once transaction committed, then the results are permanent even in the case of
    system restarts, errors etc.
