What is an Array???
======================================
1. An array is an indexed collection of homogenous data elements.

2. The main advantage of arrays is we can represent huge number of values by using single variable, so that
   readability of the code will be improved.

3. But the main disadvantage of arrays is that it is fixed in size , that is once we create an array there is no chance of increasing 
   or decreasing the size based on our requirement.

4. Hence to use arrays concept compulsory we should know the size in advanced , which may not be possible always.
