            This will give us arrayIndexOutOfBoundExecption due to i<=test.array.length
            this is because index starts from 0 and it ends at 2 here and we are trying to
            print the value at 3 which does not exist.
            
            To fix this we have to replace less then equal to with less then , than we wonâ€™t get any run time Exception.
