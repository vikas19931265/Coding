What are Inner Classes???
================================================================================

Sometimes we can declare a class inside another class , such type of classes are 
called as inner classes.

Sun people introduced inner classes in 1.1 version as part of Event Handling to 
resolve bug issues. But because of powerful features and benefits of inner classes
slowly the programmers started to utilize it in normal coding also.

Without existing one type of object if there is no chance of existing another type
of object then we should go for the inner classes.


note: Without existing outer class object there is no chance of existing inner class object.

The relationship between outer class and inner class is not a IS-A relationship but
its a HAS-A relationship.

Based upon the purpose and position of declaration all inner classes can be divided into
4 categories .

    Normal or regular Inner class
    Method or local Inner class
    Anonymous Inner Class
    Static Nested Class



Examples
==================

Example1

Without existing university object there is no chance of existing department object
hence we have to define Department class inside the university class.

Example 2

Without existing Bank object there is no chance of existing account object and hence
we have to define account class inside the bank class.
