/*

1. BROWSER-SERVLET COMMUNICATION:
===========================================================================================

-> In general in web applications, we will use browser as a client at client machine, from the browser we
  will send a request to a servlet available at server, where the servlet will be executed and generate
  some response to the client browser.

-> In the above process, we have provided communication between client browser and servlet, so that
   sending a normal request from client to server and getting a normal response from server to client is an
   example for Browser-Servlet Communication.
