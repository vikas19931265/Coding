interface in java
=============================================================================================

 An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. It has **static constants and abstract methods.

  The interface in java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract 
  methods in the java interface not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and 
  multiple inheritance in Java.

  In other words, you can say that interfaces can have methods and variables but the methods declared 
  in interface contain only method signature, not body.

  Java Interface also represents IS-A relationship.

  It cannot be instantiated just like abstract class.

Why use Java interface?
=============================================================================================

There are mainly three reasons to use interface. They are given below.

  It is used to achieve abstraction.
  By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
  It can be used to achieve loose coupling.

How to declare interface?
=============================================================================================

  Interface is declared by using interface keyword. It provides total abstraction; means all 
  the methods in interface are declared with empty body and are public and **all fields are public, static and final by default**. 
  A class that implement interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface or else should be declared as abstract.

Syntax:

interface <interface_name>{  
      
    // declare constant fields  
    // declare methods that abstract   
    // by default.  
}
