How to write a batch file????
==============================================

A batch file contains a group of commands , whenever we double click a batch file
then all the commands will be executed one by one in the sequence.


Example : create a file abc.bat with contents and then just double click. This will
         open the command prompt and execute the query.



            ----------------abc.bat-----------------------
            |
            |  java -cp C:\durga_classes   JarDemo
            |
            |
            |
            |
