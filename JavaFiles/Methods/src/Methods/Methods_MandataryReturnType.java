1. Can we create a method in java without a return Type??

Answer: No it is not possible to create a method in java without a return type.

*/
package Methods;


public class Methods_MandataryReturnType {
    
/*
    
public m1()
        
{
    
    System.out.println("m1");
}

1. This is not possible in java as it is mandatary for a method to have a return 
    type associated with it.
2. We will get the below error if trying to create a method with no return type.
    
    Error: invalid method declaration, return type is mandatary.
