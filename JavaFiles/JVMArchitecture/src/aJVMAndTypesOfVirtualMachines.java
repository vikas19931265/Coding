JVM
==================

It is a software simulation of machine which can perform operations like a 
physical machine.


Type of Virtual machine
=============================

There are two types of Virtual machines

1. Hardware based or system based Virtual machine
2. Software based or application based or process based virtual machine

Hardware based virtual machine
====================================

It provides several logical systems on the same computer with strong isolation from each other

example
    
    1. KVM(Kernal based virtusal machine) for linux systems
    2. VMware(Virtual machine ware)
    3. Xen
    4. Cloud Computing.

The main advantage of Hardaware based virtual machines is the effective utilization
of hardware resources.

Application based virtual machine
===================================

These virtual machine acts as run time engines to run to a particular programming
language applications.

Example 1: JVM(Java virtual machine) acts as run time engine to run java based 
           applications.

Example 2: PVM(parrot virtual machine) acts as run time engine to run Perl based
           applications.

Example 3: CLR(comman language runtime) acts as run time engine to run dot net based
           applications.
