/*

Conditional check(optional)
----------------------

1. Here we can take any valid java expression but should be of the type boolean
   only.

2. These part is optional and if we are not taking anything then the compiler 
   will always place true.

                   -----------------------compiler will place true here if we are leaving it blank. 
                  |  
    for(int i =0;  ; i++)
    {

    }

If we don’t place anything in the conditional check then the compiler is going to place true
in conditional check.
