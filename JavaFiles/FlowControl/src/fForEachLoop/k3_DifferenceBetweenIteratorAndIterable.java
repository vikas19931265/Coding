Differences between Iterator and Iterable(**** for interview)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Iterator(interface)                                                         Iterable(interface)                   

1. It is related to Collections.                                    It is related to for-each loop

2. We can use to retrieve the elements                               The target element in for-each loop should be
   fo collections one by one.                                       of Iterable type


3. Present in java.util. package.                                  present in java.lang package       

4. There are 3 methods present in this interface                   Only one method is present
                                                                
    1. hasNext()                                                    iterator()
    2. next()
    3. remove
