1. JDBC API is standard API. We can communicate with any database without rewriting our 
   application that is database independent API.

2. JDBC drivers are developed in java and hence JDBC concept is applicable for any platform
   that is JDBC technology is platform independent technology.

3. By Using JDBC API, we can perform basic CRUD operations very easily.

    
           C-----> CREATE
           R----->RETRIEVE
           U----->UPDATE
           D------>DELETE

4. CRUD operations is the official name given by the JDBC API.

5. These operations are also called as CURD/SCUD Operations.

6. We can perform complex operations like (inner joins, outer joins, calling stored procedures)
   etc very easily by using JDBC API.

6. JDBC API supported by large number of vendors and they developed multiple products based
   upon the JDBC API.
